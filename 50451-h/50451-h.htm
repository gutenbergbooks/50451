<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p>T<span class="smcap">he</span> typical American boy, at some period in his life, has a
taste for the mechanic arts. Before he is out of pinafores, he
surreptitiously lays hold of edged tools, and with unlimited self-confidence
tries to make something. If his success lies chiefly
in the direction of making pieces of furniture and bric-à-brac,
and the covering of his juvenile apron with gore, followed by a
tableau in which a shrieking youngster, an angry sire, and a
sympathetic mother are about equally prominent, the effect is
merely to determine the amount of the boy’s grit, and to prepare
the way, in the battles of the future, for the survival of the
fittest. While a certain number of the pinafored experimenters,
pensively regarding healed gashes and flattened thumbs, will
ever after sedulously avoid contact with chisels and hammers,
the plucky boys, who form the majority, will hardly wait for the
shedding of belladonna plasters, and the bleaching of gory
aprons, before seizing upon the instruments of their discomfiture,
with a firm determination (founded on the boyish belief in
the intelligence and moral responsibility of inanimate objects)
to let those tools know that they know how to handle them
without getting hurt. After various efforts for the mastery, the
implacable foes of the unskilful juvenile, such as the hatchet,
the saw and the hammer, will shake their sides in malignant
laughter over the final discomfiture of a second installment of
the rising generation, and will own themselves partially subject
to the ten and twelve-year-old veterans who have come triumphantly
through the struggle, and can use such tools as happen
to fall into their hands with a more or less murderous degree
of execution. To this large class of boys, intrepid, ambitious,
industrious, and full of manly instincts, America looks for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
its inventors, its engineers, architects, designers, skilled artisans,
and most successful business men in every walk in life. They
constitute, in fact, what may be termed the “Honorable Guild
of Amateur Artisans,” and it is for the benefit of the members
of this juvenile guild that “A Boy’s Workshop” is sent forth,
with the best wishes of its editors and publishers.</p>

<p>It will bring to thousands of lads just such information in
regard to the first steps in the mechanic arts as they most need,
and will enable them, with little other direction, if wisely encouraged
by their elders, to so develop whatever mechanical
ingenuity they may possess, as to make it easy to determine
whether they shall ultimately join the ranks of those wholly
devoted to the useful arts, or continue to be amateurs, using
to good advantage whatever skill they have acquired in connection
with other occupations.</p>

<p>But the parents and instructors of boys have no less reason
than the boys themselves for awarding to this book a cordial
welcome. In neither home nor school is adequate attention now
given to the training of the hands to skill in the use of any of
the tools employed in the industrial arts. It need hardly be
stated that every boy should have at least a little training in this
direction, while to thousands, such training is an essential part
of their equipment as bread-winners and as useful citizens. “A
Boy’s Workshop” is calculated to meet a need in this important
respect, and on this account alone, is worthy of a place in
the library of every home and school.</p>

<p>The desire to turn the energies of hands and brain upon constructive
work, is worthy and honorable. Let it have proper
encouragement. We have too little of the industry which follows
habits well formed, and too little of the thrift which follows
skill. Society, the State, and the nation have need of the boy who
has a workshop. May every boy who wants one, have one, and
God bless him!</p>

<h2><a name="I_THE_SHOP_ITSELF" id="I_THE_SHOP_ITSELF"></a>I.&mdash;THE SHOP ITSELF.</h2>


<p class="drop-capt">IF there is anything a boy really likes to have, it is
a workshop of his own.</p>

<p>But then it must be really his own; a place where
he can pound and hammer, saw and whittle, and
make all the litter and noise he wants to, without
having to clear up things.</p>

<p>A boy likes a place where he can leave a thing
half finished and be sure of finding it again. He
wants a key to the door, so that he can lock up his
treasures and know he shall find them safe the next
spare hour he gets to work at some pet notion.</p>

<p>Housemaids, and sometimes even mothers, don’t see
the difference between unfinished work and rubbish,
and off into the kindlings goes something that has
cost a boy a lot of thought and work. No wonder a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
fellow who isn’t a saint, but only a human boy, gets
out of patience and wishes emphatically, that “folks
would just let his things alone!”</p>

<p>So I say, let every boy have his own workshop
and a key to it.</p>

<p>Where shall the workshop be?</p>

<p>I don’t think it makes much difference. There
must be plenty of light, of course, and the room must
not be damp. My first workshop was in the attic,
with a skylight. I liked it first-rate; but it was a
bother to bring the lumber up-stairs, and then, too,
the shavings and chips had to be carried down. I
got along with it capitally though for three years;
but I like my down-stairs shop better. The noise of
pounding and sawing never disturbs any one either, if
it is below. One end of the woodshed can be partitioned
off for a shop if there is no room in the
house.</p>

<p>Now you’ve got your workshop, the next thing is,
“what shall go into it?”</p>

<p>There are two ways to fit up a workshop. The
easiest and the quickest is also the most expensive:
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</i> get your father to tell the carpenter to fit it up,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
and then buy a tool chest. The objections are: the
expense and the doubtful quality of the tools in a
ready-filled tool chest; then, to my thinking, you lose
a lot of fun yourself. It is a good lesson in carpentry
to make your own work bench and tool chest,
and the money you save that way can go into better
tools.</p>

<p>Every boy ought to remember this, a <em>cheap</em> tool is
probably a <em>dear</em> tool. The very best is really the
cheapest in the end, and you can’t do good work
with poor tools.</p>

<p>Of course the boys I am talking to are not in the
infant class. A boy who has never fooled round
with tools, who has never cared enough about carpentry
to try his hand at tinkering up broken chairs
and boxes, the boy who hasn’t got past mashing his
fingers when he drives a nail, and doesn’t know the
difference between cutting with a saw and whittling
with a knife, isn’t the boy to care whether he has
a workshop or not.</p>

<p>But I should like to help the boys who have had
“toy tool chests,” and have used them enough to find out
“they are no good,” and are really ambitious to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
neat, serviceable work, and to know enough about the
right use of good tools to be ready and able to do the
hundred little odd jobs that come up in a house and
can often be as well done by a boy carpenter as by a
regular workman. I know one boy who in one year,
doing odd jobs himself, saved the full cost of his
outfit.</p>

<p>When I began I couldn’t find anybody to tell me
the things I wanted to know. I had to find them
out for myself, and that is just what I am going to
try and tell you. So we start with this understanding.
You are in earnest; you wish to do good, substantial
work; you haven’t a great deal of money to spend,
and you are willing to let patience and labor make
up for the lack of money, knowing, too, that the
lessons you will get making your work bench and
tool chest will be worth considerable.</p>

<p>If your mother can spare you an old bureau, or an
old-fashioned washstand with a lid and a cupboard,
it will be handy in one corner of the workshop, not
only to hold your tools till the chest is made, but to
keep all sorts of odds and ends in by and by.</p>

<p>You ought to have a stout pair of overalls, or a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
workman’s apron made of ticking, with a good pocket.
I have both, and find them handy. If it’s a little job,
I slip on the apron; if a long one it pays to get into the
overalls. Your clothes keep clean, and there’s nothing
to do when the dinner bell rings but to slip off
the working uniform and wash your hands. Carpentry
is cleaner work than printing. I know, for I have
tried both.</p>

<p>Now for the list of essential tools. If it sounds
large and expensive, you must remember that once
bought they will last for years, and are your capital,
your stock in trade. From time to time you will add
to them. If you live in Boston or the vicinity, I
should advise you to go to Goodnow and Wightman’s,
176, or to Wilkinson’s, 184 Washington street, or
some other first-rate establishment, and get what you
want. On an order like this there would be quite a
discount.</p>

<p>The prices vary from time to time, so those in the
list are given simply that you may have a general idea
of the cost.</p>

<p>I will say here that it will pay you to have two or
three practical lessons in the use of a saw, a plane,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
and a chisel, from a carpenter. If you are in the
city, there are regular classes where you can get such
instructions. It will save patience and tools.</p>

<h2><a name="II_MY_SAWHORSE_AND_WORKBENCH" id="II_MY_SAWHORSE_AND_WORKBENCH"></a>II.&mdash;MY SAWHORSE AND WORKBENCH.</h2>

<p class="drop-capt">NOW that you have a fair assortment of tools to
work with, the next thing is to have a work-bench;
for even an
accomplished carpenter
can’t do
much without a
good, strong, firm
bench. And of
course you must
have a sawhorse before
you <em>can</em> have a
bench; but a sawhorse
is a simple affair to make, and I will tell
you how to set about it right away, for you ought
not to buy anything that with a little trouble you
can make. Besides it will be good, plain practise
with try-square, saw and plane.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px;">
<a name="figp013" id="figp013"></a><img src="images/i_013.jpg" width="250" height="212" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1</span></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>The sawhorse for the average boy ought to stand
about twenty or twenty-two inches high, so that you
can kneel with one knee on it easily.</p>

<p>You must get two pine boards:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<i>A</i>, 6&nbsp; feet long, 6 inches wide, 1&frac12; inches thick.<br />
<i>B</i>, 12 feet long, 6 inches wide, 1 inch thick.<br />
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Take A, cut off two and one half feet: if not
already planed, plane nicely on all sides. (Unplaned
boards are cheaper than planed boards.)</p>

<p>Take this two and one half foot board and measure
four inches from the end. Lay on try-square
and draw a line across the board at dotted line. (<i>See
right end of <a href="#figp013">fig. 1</a>.</i>)</p>

<p>Then measure five and one half inches more from
this line: with try-square extend second line across
the board. Measure one inch on all these lines from
the outer edge of board, and connect by lines <i>b b</i>
and <i>c c</i>. With cross-cut saw cut carefully through
the one inch from <i>a</i> to <i>b</i>; then with chisel cut out on
line <i>b b</i>. Don’t cut quite as deep on the lower edge,
for these openings are for the legs, and should slope
out a trifle, that the legs may be farther apart on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
floor than at the top when nailed on&mdash;one eighth of
an inch will make difference enough for a good slant.
All four leg sockets must be done alike, else your
horse will be bow-legged and unsteady.</p>

<p>Now plane the twelve-foot board <i>B</i> (unless it is
already planed). Square one end nicely; measure
off twenty-two inches. Lay try-square and draw a
line across the board. Take the cross-cut saw and
saw neatly on the line. Smooth the end with a block-plane,
bevelling it slightly, so it will fit firmly on the
floor. This is for one leg. Do three more legs in
the same way, always trimming the ends with block-plane,
to make them stand upon the floor true
and even.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 80px;">
<a name="figp015" id="figp015"></a><img src="images/i_015.jpg" width="80" height="159" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig 2</div>
</div>

<p>One thing, boys, you <em>must</em> remember:
In planing <em>across</em> the grain never plane
to the end at first, for you will chip the
corners and spoil the end. Keep reversing
the block; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</i> first plane from <i>A</i> to <i>B</i>,
then from <i>B</i> towards <i>A</i>. (<i>See <a href="#figp015">fig. 2</a>.</i>)</p>

<p>Before fitting the legs into their sockets, plane the legs
to fit the five and one half inch spaces made in the first
board. The inner upper edge of the legs must come exactly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
level with the top line of the board. The
outer edge will of course be higher on account of
the slope of the slot, and must be planed smooth
with block-plane after the legs have been firmly
nailed into place with three or four eight-penny nails.</p>

<p>To keep the legs from spreading apart at the ends,
you must make a sort of brace.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 100px;">
<a name="figp016" id="figp016"></a><img src="images/i_016.jpg" width="100" height="128" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig 3</div>
</div>

<p>Take a piece of the board left after
cutting off the legs, and fit it
across the legs under the top board
in this way: Hold it close to the
board and against the legs, then
draw a pencil line, following the
outside slant of the legs. (<i>See <a href="#figp016">fig.
3</a>.</i>) Now with cross-cut saw cut across on this line;
trim with block-plane before nailing; put one piece
on each end, nailing through to the legs.</p>

<p>One thing more and then your horse is done;
ready to stand if not to go.</p>

<p>Find the middle of one end of top board, draw a
line three inches long down the board, with try-square.
Then <em>on the end</em> measure one inch each side
of this centre line. (<i>See <a href="#figp018">fig. 4</a>.</i>) Draw line from <i>a</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
to <i>b</i>, and cut on lines with splitting-saw; this will
leave a triangular space which you will find very
useful by and by in cutting small pieces of
wood.</p>

<p>From board <i>A</i> there ought to be left a piece about
three and one half feet long, and from board <i>B</i> a
piece about two feet long. These you will put aside
for further use.</p>

<p>Now for the Bench (with a capital B, because it
is the principal partner in the firm of Carpenter and
Co.).</p>

<p>Buy three good two-inch pine planks. Say two
planks ten feet long, one foot wide, and one eight feet
long, six inches wide. Ready planed, at the sawmills
around here, these cost about eight cents a foot;
a little less unplaned. Besides these, you want one
ten-foot inch board, one foot wide; this should cost
about four cents a foot. Before you really start on
your Bench, look around your workshop and decide
where you will have it stand. There must be a space
ten feet long against the wall, with plenty of light.
A window at the left is the best.</p>

<p>One thing you must have which I didn’t reckon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
with the tools; but it is easy to prepare. I mean a <em>chalk
line</em>. There are fancy ones,
but the sort I’m going to
describe does just as well.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<a name="figp018" id="figp018"></a><img src="images/i_018.jpg" width="200" height="60" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig 4</div>
</div>

<p>Get a piece of curtain-cord
twelve or fifteen feet long, and make a loop
on one end; then provide yourself with a good piece
of common chalk; when you want to use it, chalk
the line well by passing the line over the chalk as
you would wax thread; to use it put the loop over
a nail at one end of the line you wish to chalk, hold
the other taut, and snap the line smartly in the middle;
it will leave a straight chalk line for a guide in
cutting.</p>

<p>Now take the shorter of the two-inch planks, the
one eight feet long, make a mark in the middle
of each end, drive a small nail in the left-hand
end exactly in the middle; having chalked your line
well, slip the loop over the nail, draw the line taut
down the middle of the board to the other or right-hand
end, holding the line close to the board; pluck
the string sharply in the middle and you will find an
even chalk line the whole length of the board.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>Put one end of the board over sawhorse, take the
splitting-saw and cut carefully down the line, holding
the saw a little more vertical than you would a cross-cut
saw.</p>

<p>Having divided your board thus, lengthwise, you
will have two strips eight feet long, three inches wide,
two inches thick.</p>

<p>With large plane smooth the rough sides of these
strips as well as you can, resting the boards on the
sawhorse. One end of each
strip must be good and
square: if not so already,
take small block-plane and
square it as best you can.</p>

<p>From the squared end
measure thirty inches; draw
a line across the board.
Then by aid of try-square
make another line one
eighth inch beyond. This makes it easy to saw
straight across the wood with a cross-cut saw. Take
block-plane and square the end nicely.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<a name="figp019" id="figp019"></a><img src="images/i_019.jpg" width="200" height="231" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig 5</div>
</div>

<p>You have now prepared one leg of your bench<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Cut another thirty-inch length in the same way from
the piece left. Repeat this with the other strip.
You now have four legs for your bench just alike
with nicely squared ends.</p>

<p>For cross-pieces cut from the pieces that remain
two lengths of nineteen inches each; cut and trim as
before.</p>

<p>Take one pair of legs (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</i> two of the thirty-inch
strips), lay them on the floor on the <em>two-inch</em> side, just
<em>nineteen inches</em> apart. At one end, between the legs, lay
one of the nineteen-inch pieces <em>also on the two-inch side</em>,
so it will be flush with the squared ends of the legs;
hammer the legs on to the ends of the cross pieces
with two or three twenty-penny nails. This job
ought to be done very neatly and accurately, so that
the shape will be exactly like <a href="#figp019">fig. 5</a>. If you are careless
and let the legs spread while nailing, your Bench
will be hopelessly rickety.</p>

<h2><a name="III_MY_SAWHORSE_AND_WORKBENCH" id="III_MY_SAWHORSE_AND_WORKBENCH"></a>III.&mdash;MY SAWHORSE AND WORKBENCH.
(<i>Continued.</i>)</h2>


<p class="drop-capt">TO give greater firmness to the bench there must
be some brace made this way: Take the
ten-foot inch board; square one end; measure
twenty-three inches with try-square; cut off nicely
with cross-cut saw. Now you have a board twenty-three
inches long and twelve inches wide. Divide in
middle at each end; connect the points with chalk
line, then cut down this line with splitting saw.</p>

<p>You will have two pieces twenty-three inches long
and six inches wide; these are the two end braces.
Lay one of these pieces across the legs you have just
joined, at the closed end. All the edges must be
flush; if not, plane them and make them true. You
will see that if you have measured and cut carefully
they will come right, for the legs are each two inches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
thick, making four inches, and the cross-piece is
nineteen inches, making twenty-three in all; just the
length of your brace. Nail the brace firmly into
both legs and cross-piece with six-penny nails. Do
the same with the other set of legs.</p>

<p>Now in the space you have chosen for your bench,
stand up both pairs of legs endwise to the wall, and
six feet apart, leaving full two feet clear beyond, as
your bench will be ten feet long when done.</p>

<p>Take the two big planks (the ten foot ones, two
inches thick), measure two feet from each end of each
plank: draw a line in direction <i>a a</i>. (<i>See <a href="#figp025">fig. 6</a>.</i>) Then
parallel to <i>a a</i>, draw another, <i>b b</i>, one inch farther
toward the middle of the board; then another, <i>c c</i>, an
inch beyond that, always measuring away from the
ends. On these lines <i>a a</i> and <i>b b</i> mark the places
for your screws in alternate spaces, thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<a name="figp022" id="figp022"></a><img src="images/i_022.jpg" width="300" height="56" alt="pattern" />
</div>


<p>Remember always that screws or nails put in diagonally
like that hold more firmly than the same number
in a straight line.</p>

<p>Before putting in the screws, see that the legs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
stand parallel and close to the wall; put the first
board on the legs so that the back edge of board is
even with the back edge of the legs. Screw firmly
into place, taking care to have the outer edge of the
legs directly under the first or dotted line; this
brings the screws evenly along the cross-piece.</p>

<p>Lay the second board close to the first, securing in
same way; the front edge of this second board ought
to project one inch beyond the legs. The heads of
the screws on the top of the bench must be sunk.
You have left a board eight feet long, one foot wide,
and one inch thick.</p>

<p>This board is to be put on in front directly under
the top board and against the legs. It should come
flush at the <em>right end</em> only, leaving space of two feet
at the left. Nail this board on to the legs with six-penny
nails. You have now a capital bench, which
only needs a vise to complete it.</p>

<p>Cut from the board <i>B</i> (left from sawhorse) a length
of eighteen inches. Square both ends nicely; lay
this against the left hand front leg, flush with the
outer edge and coming close under the front board,
and nail firmly on to leg.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>For seventy-five cents at a hardware store, you can
buy a wooden screw about two feet long for vise, with
shank one and three fourths
inches diameter.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">
<a name="figp024" id="figp024"></a><img src="images/i_024.jpg" width="250" height="313" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig 7</div>
</div>

<p>On the front board, ten
inches from top of bench,
and about five inches from
left edge, draw a circle one
and three fourths inches in
diameter; this circle when
cut out should come as
close to the leg as possible
without cutting it.</p>

<p>To cut this hole take a five eighths bit and bore a
series of holes round the inside of the one and three
fourths inch circle. (<i>See <a href="#figp024">fig. 7</a>.</i>)</p>

<p>The piece in the middle will fall out and leave a rather
rough hole; but the edges can easily be trimmed.</p>

<p>Then take the board <i>A</i> (the three and one half foot
piece), cut it thirty-one inches long. Square one end
and then round it as at <i>D</i>. (<i>See <a href="#figp028">fig. 8</a>.</i>) On the back
side draw a pencil line through the middle; place
the board against the left leg, with the sharp edge
flush with <em>top</em> of bench, so that the pencil line will
bisect the circular hole. Draw a similar circle on
the board, and cut out as before.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>

<div class="caption">Fig 6</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Be careful in the doing of this, as the two holes
must be exactly opposite for the screw to pass
through. You ought to have two bits of wood left
after cutting the legs and cross-pieces. Take one of
these bits and put behind the front board on its
two inch side and about three inches to the right of
the left leg and parallel with the leg. It should just
clear the hole. Fasten securely, so that it will cross
the joint <i>A</i>. It will serve as a brace, and also give a
level bearing for the wooden nut which comes with
the screw and is wound on the end of screw after it
passes through the two holes.</p>

<p>Your vise as it is will work all right for small
pieces, but if you have a large article to hold, the
loose board <i>b</i> will not keep its parallel position, for
the thickness of the object you have in above will
throw out the top end, and the lower end will of
course swing in. To remedy this and make your
vise adjustable to work of any size, you must do one
more thing:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>A little to the right of leg, and one inch from the
lower edge of the fixed upright, cut a slot two inches
high and one inch wide; make a corresponding hole
in the loose upright.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;">
<a name="figp028" id="figp028"></a><img src="images/i_028.jpg" width="200" height="214" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig 8</div>
</div>

<p>Take a strip of board two feet long, two inches
wide, and one inch thick. On a
line drawn lengthwise through
the middle measure one inch from
end and mark; then two inches
from that point on same line make
a second mark; at both those
points bore holes with half-inch
bit and fit in a peg at each hole. The pegs will be
one and one half inches apart.</p>

<p>Then at intervals of one inch bore two alternate
rows of holes with half-inch bit, as far as the length
of the strip allows. Run this strip through the slot in
loose board as in <a href="#figp028"><i>fig 8</i></a>, and through the corresponding
slot in upright put a peg in <i>a</i> in <em>front</em> of loose board
and a peg in <i>b</i> <em>behind</em> loose board; these pegs will
hold the strip firm in the slot in the loose board.</p>

<p>According to the size of the object to be held in
use, draw the loose board toward you and put third<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
peg into hole at proper distance to keep the loose
board parallel with the fixed upright.</p>

<p>You see by having holes enough in the strip you
can adjust the vise to any size. Of course you
understand that this is not needed in small work.</p>

<p>If you look closely at <a href="#figp025"><i>fig 6</i></a> you will find that there
is still one thing unexplained: the rows of holes in
the front board.</p>

<p>When you have some long piece of work in your
vise you will find it troublesome to keep it level; if
you have a number of holes bored in the front of
bench, with a good peg to fit, by changing the peg
according to the height desired, you can raise the right
end of your piece of work to the right level.</p>

<p>A plain hook is a desirable addition to the work-bench:
its use is to hold a board when you wish
to plane the surface. It is adjustable according to
the thickness of the board, and should be set in and
screwed on to the bench at point Y. It will cost at
hardware store about seventy-five cents.</p>

<h2><a name="IV_USE_OF_TOOLS" id="IV_USE_OF_TOOLS"></a>IV.&mdash;USE OF TOOLS.</h2>


<p class="drop-capt">WE begin with the saws, of which you have two:
cross-cut saw, and splitting saw.</p>

<p>The use of a cross-cut saw, as the name implies, is
to cut <em>across</em> the grain or fibre of the wood: it is one
of the most indispensable tools we have. The teeth
are finer and closer together than those of the splitting
saw, which, as the name describes, is intended to
cut <em>with</em> the grain, usually lengthwise, of a piece of
wood. Never try to substitute one for the other, for
you would injure your tools. When you want to use
a cross-cut saw, the saw should be held at an angle
of about forty-five degrees, and must also be held
steadily without swerving to the right or left; otherwise
the teeth of the saw will stick, and you cannot
make a clean cut.</p>

<p>You will observe in looking at a saw that the teeth
are <em>set</em>, as it is called; every other point turning a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
away to the right or left of a straight line; the reason
of this is, to make the cut wider than the saw blade;
otherwise after cutting in a little way the friction
would make the blade bind. Saws are, or should
be, in proper condition to use when they are bought;
if not, or if by any accident the teeth should get bent,
you must have the saw <em>set</em> without meddling with it
yourself.</p>

<p>A splitting saw is used differently from a cross-cut
saw; it should be held more nearly upright; the cutting
is always done on the <em>down</em> stroke. Never press
the saw against the wood; the teeth will catch, and
the saw bend, and the wood won’t be cut if you add
any weight to that of the saw itself.</p>

<p>There is a certain amount of knack required in
order to saw well, but practise will improve even the
most awkward workman. Always saw slowly and
easily, in a sort of regular time. Be sure the wood is
held firmly and doesn’t <em>hop</em>.</p>


<h3>USE OF PLANES.</h3>

<p>We have jack-planes, smoothing-planes, and block-planes.
When you want to make aboard thinner, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
smoother, it has got to be planed; also the sides and
edges of a board are sometimes rough, or you wish
to bevel them.</p>

<p>If the grain of the wood is perfect, there is no
trouble about planing in either direction, but generally
the grain runs in a slight slant or angle to the surface
of the board instead of parallel to it. If, then, you
start your plane and plane “against the grain” of the
board, the edge of the plane will catch in ends of the
grain lines, and the surface will be chipped instead of
smoothed. If, however, you start it and plane “with
the grain,” the ends of the grain lines are smoothed
down, like the feathers on a bird’s wing when you
stroke it down instead of up. So it is well to be sure
about the grain before you begin to plane. Sometimes
the grain is twisted and runs one way in one
part of the board and another way in another part in
a wavy line. Then you must vary the planing according
to the surface. You would soon learn these simple
things perhaps, but to know them at the outset
will save you some vexation.</p>

<p>The smoothing-plane is much shorter than the jack-plane,
and is used for smoothing smaller pieces which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
would be lost under the jack-plane, and also for
smoothing inequalities left by the jack-plane. I have
put no smoothing-plane on your list, as for ordinary
work the block-plane can be used as a smoothing-plane.
Thus: Turn the small thumb-screw at the
front of the block-plane and press it forward; this
opens the mouth of the plane so that the plane can
be <em>set</em> more and cut a larger shaving.</p>

<p>Now for the proper use of the block-plane, remembering
to restore it to its original <em>set</em> if you have been
using it as a smoothing-plane. To smooth the ends
of boards you need a small plane which can be <em>set</em>
very fine; i. e., with the blade projecting very little
from the face of the plane, and with the mouth so
closed that the blade will not chip in cutting.</p>

<p>One important principle must be practically learned
before you can do good work: <em>Everything in carpentry
from beginning to end must be done on the square.</em>
In planing, above all things, the square must begin
every bit of work, and end it, and be used to test it,
all the way along; it is just what the name implies, a
<em>try square</em>; so perhaps the next thing explained had
better be some of the uses of the square.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>To give all the uses of this apparently simple tool
would be to give you a thorough knowledge of geometry,
and fill a volume. I will, however, give some of
the more common uses:</p>

<p>1. In sawing across a board, if you wish to have
the cut true and even, you must use the square. One
edge is, of course, already planed, and from this all
your lines are drawn. You wish, we will suppose, to
saw three inches from the end of your board; lay the
thick or handle part of the square close against the
even edge of the board, three inches from the end;
you will find that the blade lies flat across, the board
at a right angle with the edge, and a pencil line
drawn close to the blade will be a guide for cutting.</p>

<p>2. To test the evenness of the end of a board
which you have been trimming with a block-plane:
Apply the square to the side and edge of the board;
if the work is true, the blade will be level with the end
of the board; if uneven, the defect is quickly seen.</p>

<p>3. It is well to test your square itself; thus: Lay
your square snug against a straight edge with the
handle to the left; draw a line where the edge of the
blade comes: then reverse the square, having the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
handle to the right; draw a similar line: if the square
is true the lines will coincide; if they diverge ever so
little the square is imperfect, and you should buy another.</p>

<p>4. In planing the edge of a board, put the handle
of the square against the <em>face</em> of the board; the blade
will then go across the edge, and you can soon see if
it is even; i. e., at right angles with the face of the
board.</p>

<p>Hammering a nail seems a very simple thing, but
there’s a right way and a wrong way to do that, as
you’ll find for yourself after you’ve split two or three
bits of work; but you might as well learn the right
way at first.</p>

<p>If you look at a nail of any size, from a brad to a
twenty-penny spike, you will find that the sides are
parallel and straight, and two are wedge-shape or
sloping; also one of the straight sides is finished
smooth, the other is rough. A nail is virtually a
wedge. Now the principle of the wedge is to split
things when the wedge goes with the grain, as when
you split a board with an axe or hatchet; for an axe
is a wedge, as you will see if you think about it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>If, then, your nail is put in wedge-fashion <em>with</em> the
grain, ten to one the second good tap with your hammer
splits the board; if, however, you turn the nail
the other way, so the wedge side is <em>across</em> the grain,
and the straight side <em>with</em> the grain, the nail is held
firm by the grain pressing against the wedge, and the
board doesn’t split. This is the reason that fine work
is done with brads better than with tacks, for tacks
are wedge-shaped on all sides, and in driving them if
the wood is thin it is very apt to split.</p>

<p>Always <em>start</em> a nail in the direction you mean to
have it <em>go</em>, and don’t depend on straightening it afterwards.
If, however, it gets a wrong slant, don’t bend
it back with your fingers, nor hit it a knock sideway
with your hammer which will likely enough break the
nail short off; but with every regular stroke of your
hammer give an inclination in the right way, and it
will get there.</p>

<p>Don’t hold on to the nail too long; in soft wood
the second hammer tap ought to find the nail firm
enough to stay. Don’t make the first or the second
hammer stroke a long hard one; if you do, likely as
not you’ll mash your fingers. The first tap should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
light and short; get the swing gradually, a few inches
first, adding a few inches more with each stroke; by
the time you want full force to drive the nail home,
you’ll find you can’t hit anywhere but on the head of
the nail. This is something that practise alone can
make you perfect in. If you watch a good building-carpenter,
it seems as if he threw the nail into place
with one hand and hit it on the way.</p>

<p>Don’t think you must look at each nail in order to
place it right. Your eyes must be in your finger tips;
<em>the smooth side goes with the grain</em>.</p>

<p>Always keep the different sizes of nails separate;
then you won’t be bothered by finding the wrong nail
in your fingers when you are in the midst of a job.</p>

<p>In using chisels and gouges never strike with a
hammer, but always with a wooden mallet; the hammer
splits the handles.</p>

<p>In most chisel work it is better to put the bevel
edge to the line you wish to cut until you have cut
out most of the wood, then finish with the other edge
and the pressure of your hand instead of the mallet.</p>

<p>It will be easier to explain the use of the other
tools as we come to them in construction.</p>

<h2><a name="V_HOW_TO_MAKE_A_TOOL_CABINET" id="V_HOW_TO_MAKE_A_TOOL_CABINET"></a>V.&mdash;HOW TO MAKE A TOOL CABINET.</h2>


<p class="drop-capt">NOW that you’ve got some very good tools, it
is time you knew how to take care of them as
well as to use them.</p>

<p>The best tools will grow rusty and dull, and shabby,
also, even if they don’t hide away out of sight just
when you most want to use them, unless you have a
proper place to put them and <em>always remember to put
them in that place when you have done using them</em>.</p>

<p>I suppose you think you must have a tool chest
for this; now a tool chest is a very good thing if you
want to carry your tools on a journey, i. e. if you are
a city boy and want to take your kit up into the
country and have the tools safe from jarring under
the hands of the baggage-smashers; but I’ve found
that a tool chest isn’t as handy to have in the work
shop as a tool cabinet; so I’m going to tell you how
to make a good tool cabinet with less expense of money,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
material and labor than a tool chest would require.</p>

<p>But you must be more exact and careful in measuring
and cutting than you had to be in making the
sawhorse and bench. In getting your materials, try
to have the boards fully one foot wide and three
fourths of an inch thick. It is easier to make estimates
on these dimensions, and foot boards are
usually the easier to obtain; so all the measures for
the cabinet are made with reference to these dimensions.
If you happen to have boards that are wider
or narrower, you must do a little figuring on your
own account and make the proper allowance.</p>

<p>For a tool cabinet three feet three inches long and
two feet wide, which will hold all the tools on the
list given in the first paper and leave room for several
more that you will be likely to own by and by, you
must have one six-foot board fully twelve inches wide
and three fourths of an inch thick; one seven-foot
board, twelve inches wide, one half inch thick; one
nine-foot board, twelve inches wide, one half inch
thick; also a number of three fourths inch screws
which you are supposed to have in stock; one pair
brass (or iron) hinges for three fourths inch board,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
and a hook for fastening, unless you prefer a lock.</p>

<p>Take three fourths inch board (the one six feet
long), plane both edges; then by aid of chalk line
and splitting-saw, cut off a strip two and one half
inches wide, running the whole length of the board.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>The board that remains should be nine and one
half inches wide. Smooth the edge with plane enough
to remove the roughness left by the saw; then cut off
another strip two and one half inches wide like the
first. Smooth the edge of the remaining seven-inch
board; then divide this seven-inch board into two
even strips which will be six feet long and about
three and one half inches wide, perhaps a trifle less,
from the loss in planing.</p>

<p>All these strips will have one edge that has been
planed and one left rough by the saw. If you lay
them together you will find that you have two pairs
of strips; one pair two and one half inches wide, and
one pair three and one half inches wide. <em>Each pair</em>
must be alike in width, otherwise the cabinet will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
uneven and lobsided; so before going any farther lay
the strips together and plane down any inequalities.</p>

<p>Now take one of the three and one half inch strips
with try square and block plane. Square one end;
measure three feet three inches from squared end and
allow one eighth inch for waste in cutting.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> Cut off
square with cross-cut saw. Square end of piece cut
and also of piece remaining. Measure twenty-two
and one fourth inches and cut and plane as before.
Do the same with the other three and one half inch
strip. You have now two sides and top and bottom
of main part of cabinet, and some small bits left for
which we shall find a use, i. e. you have two pieces
three feet three inches long and three and one half
inches wide, for sides, and two pieces twenty-two and
one fourth inches long and three and one half inches
wide for top and bottom.</p>

<p>Now take the two and one half inch strips; cut
three feet three inches off each, also twenty-two and
one fourth inches as with the others. Each set of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
pieces must be alike in length and width; you have
two pieces three feet three inches long and two and
one half inches wide, and two pieces twenty-two and
one fourth inches long, two and one half inches wide;
these are for sides, and top and bottom of door of
cabinet. Lay these four pieces aside while we get
ready for the back of the cabinet and front part of
door.</p>

<p>From the seven-foot board (after planing and
squaring one end) cut off three feet three inches;
plane square the ends and cut off another piece three
feet three inches.<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a></p>

<p>From the nine-foot board in the same way cut two
similar pieces three feet three inches; smooth edges,
planing off as little as possible.</p>

<div class="caption">THE TOOL CABINET OPEN.</div>
</div>

<p>The piece remaining will measure about two and
one half feet in length; from this cut off a piece
twenty-two and one fourth inches long. Saw strip
three and one half inches wide, which to save confusion
we will mark <i>A</i>; plane edges, cut off another
strip two and one half inches wide; mark this <i>B</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Next a strip three and one half inches wide; mark
this <i>C</i>. Cut <i>C</i> so as to measure seventeen and one
half inches in length.</p>

<p>The cabinet is now mostly cut out; the next step
is to put it together.</p>

<p>Take pieces for sides and top and bottom of cabinet.
Lay two sides parallel at a distance of twenty-two
and one fourth inches apart; put top and bottom
in so they will be flush with end of sides. Nail the
sides on to ends with six or eight-penny nails. Take
care to keep the corners square, as they will be if
the edges are even and kept flush.</p>

<p>Before nailing on the back test the squareness of
the frame in this way (unless your eye is very accurate;
even then it is a good thing to get in the habit
of measuring exactly): measure the diagonals from
the opposite corner. If the measures are alike, all
right; if, however, one diagonal be longer than the
other, make it right with gentle, steady pressure on
each corner with both hands. When the diagonals
are exactly alike the corners will also be right angles.
Now lay on two of the two and one half inch pieces
(those three feet three inches long and one foot wide);<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
be sure and keep all the edges flush and nail firmly.</p>

<p>Do the same with pieces prepared for doors, and
you will find you have two shallow boxes three feet
three inches long and two feet wide (outside measure);
one will be three and one half inches deep, the
other two and one half inches deep.</p>

<p>Now take piece marked <i>A</i>, which is for a shelf in
the cabinet; measure and mark six and one half
inches from right hand end (this is the length for
the small plane); then measure and mark another one
half inch beyond this point; from this <em>last</em> point
measure length of your oilstone, which is probably six
or eight inches. The space remaining will make a
sort of box, or tray, for rule, chalk line and reel, pencils,
etc., when you have made some use of the bits of
wood you had left after cutting the shelves.</p>

<p>In the one half inch space between place for plane
and oilstone put a little block one half inch wide
and one inch long. At the end of space for oilstone
nail a strip an inch wide across the shelf, and
a similar strip in front. This makes one side and
front of tray; the other side and back will be formed
by the cabinet itself.</p>

<h2><a name="VI_HOW_TO_MAKE_A_TOOL_CABINET" id="VI_HOW_TO_MAKE_A_TOOL_CABINET"></a>
VI.&mdash;HOW TO MAKE A TOOL CABINET. (<i>Continued.</i>)</h2>


<p class="drop-capt">AFTER shelf <i>A</i> is fitted in this way, you will
nail it into its place in cabinet so that the top
of shelf is just seven inches above top of lower shelf,
or bottom of cabinet which serves for a shelf.</p>

<p>After the shelf is fitted into its place in the cabinet,
you will find that at one end you have a convenient
little tray to hold such things as chalk-line, rule, pencils,
and other small things that are always getting
out of sight when you most need them. The plan for
<i>A</i> is just six inches above lower shelf (or bottom of
cabinet).</p>

<p>N. B. All measurements now are inside measurements.</p>

<p><i>B</i> is twenty-two and one fourth inches long and
two and one half inches wide. Draw a line down the
middle of this strip (i. e., one and one fourth inches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
from each side). Measure one inch from left-hand
end and mark. Then from this point on pencil line
measure one and one half inches and mark again.
Repeat this until you have six points marked on the
pencil line, with one and one half inch spaces between.
From the last point measure one inch, and mark.
Repeat at intervals of one inch until you have thirteen
with inch spaces. This should leave about three
fourths of an inch on right end.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a name="figp048" id="figp048"></a><img src="images/i_048.jpg" width="400" height="102" alt="" />
<div class="caption">TOOL-DOORS.</div>
</div>

<p>On the first six marks (those one and one half inches
apart) bore five eighths inch auger holes. These are
for tool sockets. First two for the chisels you have
already; next three for the chisels or gouges you may
have; the last for the screwdriver.</p>

<p>There must be doors for the tools to enter by; so
you must cut openings one half inch wide from the
front of shelf to each hole. This is easily done with
your cross-cut saw, leaving spaces as in drawing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>You have still thirteen marks with inch spaces.
Bore nine holes a trifle larger than the shanks of the
bits you are to place therein; three of these bits you
already have; the other six spaces are for the bits
you are likely to purchase by and by.</p>

<p>The four remaining marks are for holes graduated
in size, thus: First, one with three eighths inch bit
(one of those belonging to smaller set); second, with
one fourth inch; third and fourth, with the next
smaller sizes; each bit going into a hole a size larger
than itself. These smaller bits go in <em>point down</em>.
It will be a great convenience to mark the numbers
of the bits on the shelf against their sockets.</p>

<p>Shelf <i>B</i> is to be nailed twenty and one fourth
inches above shelf <i>A</i>.</p>

<p>Now for shelf <i>C</i>. Ten inches from left-hand end,
put small one half inch block for same purpose as
similar block on shelf <i>A</i>; i. e., to keep plane from
sliding. Nail shelf <i>C</i> three inches above shelf <i>A</i> in
left-hand side of cabinet. This little shelf of course
does not reach across the cabinet like the others.</p>

<p>Six and one fourth inches above shelf <i>C</i>, and four
inches from left-hand side of cabinet, bore hole with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
one half inch bit, which shall have a slant downward.
Parallel to this, and eight inches to the right, make
another hole just like it. Insert in these holes wooden
pegs two inches long. Be sure they fit firmly with
back of cabinet. These pegs are for the draw-shave
to hang upon, as seen in diagram.</p>

<p>Ten and three fourth inches above shelf <i>A</i>, and
three inches from right-hand side, make one half inch
hole slanting down; one and one half inches beyond
make another; insert pegs three inches long. These
are for the mallet.</p>

<p>The body of the cabinet is now fitted, and we will
go to work on the cover.</p>

<p>Take two blocks one inch square and one and one
half inches long; draw a line lengthwise exactly in
the centre of each; cut down the line one half inch
deep the length of block. Put one of these blocks slit
uppermost on bottom shelf of door four inches from
left-hand corner. Five and one half inches to the
right, put the other; fasten into place with screws.</p>

<p>Twenty-one inches above first block, four and one
half inches from side of door, put block one inch
square, one and one half inches long. This goes on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
horizontally, parallel with lower block. In centre of
this make small hole, say one fourth inch deep, with
smallest bit.</p>

<p>Make a second block just like it, and place five
and one half inches to the right of the first one.</p>

<p>Then from one half inch wood, cut two little strips
two inches long, one half inch wide, for buttons. In
the middle bore hole large enough for screw to turn
freely; attach to middle of upper blocks with screws.
The tips of the saw-blades go into the slits in the lower
blocks. The openings in the handles slip over the
wooden buttons which you have just made, and which
are horizontal when the saws are put on, and are then
turned like the button on a barn door to hold the
saws firmly in place.</p>

<p>Now we must provide for the hatchet, so it will
not get harm nor do harm.</p>

<p>Take block of one inch wood, five inches long,
three inches wide; plane one half of one face in
a slant from the middle, so one edge will be three
fourths thick, leaving one half the block one inch
thick, as at first. Bore two holes in the half that is
still square, big enough for two screws to go through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
and fasten on to lower shelf or bottom of door. This
block in its place is one inch wide at the bottom, and
three fourths inches at top, leaving a kind of bevel
five inches long for hatchet-blade, between block and
back of door. Put hatchet in; hold it upright and
mark where handle needs support to keep it horizontal;
probably about nine inches from blade; with
screws fasten on two small brackets, or else put in
slanting pegs, if you do not care about the looks outside.</p>

<p>Four inches from top, and five and one half inches
from left-hand side, put similar bracket or peg; three
and one half inches further, on the same line, put
another; these will serve to support the bit brace,
and I have left enough room for the keyhole-saw,
which you can see in the diagram, and which some
time you will like to own.</p>

<p>Now cut a piece of wood three inches long, two
inches wide, and three fourths inches thick; draw
line across one end and down the edge two inches
long.</p>

<p>Cut this line out as you did for the slits for the
saws, and then (slit up of course) with two screws<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
put through the lower part, fasten block at point ten
inches from right-hand side, just far enough above
the saws to clear them. This is for the try square,
the slit being for the blade.</p>

<p>Fifteen inches from left-hand side, and four inches
from top, put a bracket; on the same line, one and
one half inches farther from the left side, put another;
these are for the hammer.</p>

<p>You now have all your tools in place. You will in
all probability have had some tools in the house
before we began, such as pincers, gimlets, perhaps
a saw; but of course I have not a list of those
things.</p>

<p>So I have simply given you a good deal of room to
put them in, and by this time you ought to know how
to secure them in their places.</p>

<h2><a name="VII_HINGES_AND_LOCK" id="VII_HINGES_AND_LOCK"></a>VII.&mdash;HINGES AND LOCK.</h2>


<p class="drop-capt">TO make the tool cabinet complete there must be
hinges and a lock. These you can get at
a hardware store. Ask for hinges for three quarters
inch wood, and about three inches long; you will
need three hinges, and the screws to fit the holes.
Brass hinges are best, and look neater and more
tasteful than iron, though iron will do. If the screws
don’t come with the hinges, then look out some that
will fit, from your stock on hand.</p>

<p>The first thing for you to settle is which way you
wish the cabinet to open; i. e. to the right as in the
diagram, or to the left as might be if the only place
for your cabinet happened to be a corner which
would not admit of opening to the right. Suppose
the door is to open to the right. Find the middle of
the front edge of the right hand side of <em>cabinet</em>.
Mark across the edge, then measure one and one half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
inches <em>each way</em> from that line and mark. This is
the place for the middle hinge. Five inches from
the lower corner on the same side, and five inches
from the upper corner measure and mark; then
measure three inches further from these last lines
and mark; these are for upper and lower hinges.
In these three spaces, so marked, cut out rectangles
as deep as the thickness of one wing of the hinge.</p>

<p>Repeat these measurements, markings and cuttings
on the <em>left</em> hand side of cover or door. Be careful in
measuring so that the two halves of the cabinet will
come together and exactly match.</p>

<p>Now to put on the hinges: Take one hinge, shut
it together <em>tight</em>, so as to be sure you are folding
it the right way; then open till the wings are at right
angles. Lay <em>left</em> wing into space cut for it in <em>right</em>
side of cabinet. Take care to have the wing fit
neatly, letting the round edge of hinge project.
Screw firmly into place. Put all the hinges in place
on the cabinet before beginning on the cover.</p>

<p>Now lay the cabinet down flat on your workbench,
or on the floor. Put the cover down beside it, with
a bit of board or blocks underneath thick enough to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
bring the hinge places of the door on a level with
those of the cabinet. Then fasten the <em>right</em> hand
wings of hinges into the places prepared on the <em>left</em>
side of door. Be careful, as before, to have the
round part of hinge project so that it will work freely
and have the <em>wings flush</em> with inside of cabinet and
door.</p>

<p>When open, there will be a narrow space between
the door and cabinet, but when closed
they will fit tight.</p>

<p>Now for a fastening: If you simply
wish to keep the cabinet closed
when not in use, you can put a hook
on the door, the eye on the cabinet. If however you
wish to lock up your tools for safe keeping, you must
invest in a good lock and key. The best sort for your
purpose is what is called a chest-lock. (<a href="#figp056"><i>Fig. 1.</i></a>) They
come in various sizes, so I can’t give exact measurements.
It must of course go in the middle of the
side opposite the hinges.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;">
<a name="figp056" id="figp056"></a><img src="images/i_056.jpg" width="150" height="141" alt="" />
<div class="caption">FIG. 1.</div>
</div>

<p>As you look at the lock you will see that one face
is smooth, and the other side, where you find the
keyhole, is irregular. This irregular part is the one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
that sets into the wood. From the inside of cabinet
(opposite the middle hinge) cut a place to correspond
in size with the lock so that it will fit neatly. The
opening for the key must of course be cut through
on to the outside of cabinet. Be careful to do this
neatly and cut out no more than is needful for the
key to pass in freely.</p>

<p>By and by, on a bit of nicer work, I will tell you
how to put on a scutcheon to guard the keyhole, but
it isn’t necessary for this. The other part of the
lock which has the tongue, or tongues, is fitted into
the door of the cabinet in the same way; the tongues
of course projecting from the edge of the side. Be
careful to have them come exactly opposite the openings
for them in the cabinet side. <em>You cannot be too
exact in carpentry.</em> The next thing is to fasten the
cabinet securely against the wall. Of course you can
stand it on the end of your bench, but it is better on
the wall.</p>

<p>You will need four strips of brass four inches long,
one inch wide, and about one eighth thick, with four
holes for screws bored in each piece. Two of these
go on the top corners, and two on the lower corners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
of cabinet. Put them on so that the screws will go
through into the inch-thick side of cabinet, not
merely into the thinner back. Half the length of
the brass piece with two holes must project
above on the upper corners, and below
on lower corners. (<a href="#figp058"><i>Fig. 2.</i></a>)</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;">
<a name="figp058" id="figp058"></a><img src="images/i_058.jpg" width="150" height="158" alt="" />
<div class="caption">FIG. 2.</div>
</div>

<p>You will want some one to hold the
cabinet steady for you while you secure
it with long heavy screws, two at each
corner. Of course your tools are not in the cabinet
while you are at work upon it.</p>

<p>One word of caution: If the cabinet is to go in a
corner, leave a few inches (i. e. the thickness of the
door) measured outside between the wall and hinges,
or you’ll find you can’t open the door.</p>

<p>If you have carefully followed all the directions,
you have now a good, plain, serviceable tool cabinet.</p>

<p>If you would like to stain it, which would improve
the looks, I will try to tell you how. You must not
get discouraged if the first attempt doesn’t turn out
very well, for one must practise even to stain well;
but the cabinet is a good thing to start with. Of
course the staining is easier done before the cabinet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
is hung; but a neat workman can do it on the wall.</p>

<p>First determine the color you wish your stain to be.
I should say black walnut, as it is the easiest to put
on, and you will not be likely to tire of it. The
quantities I give will do more than the cabinet; but
if stoppered tight will keep for future use, and for very
small quantities you have to pay exorbitant prices.</p>

<p>I haven’t much faith in home-made stains; they
cost about as much, and are not very satisfactory. At
any oil or paint shop, get a quart of stain, which will
cost forty or fifty cents; one fourth pound <em>clear</em> glue
for sizing&mdash;this ought not to be more than eight or
nine cents; one quart nice varnish (what is called
<em>inside</em> coach varnish is the best), this will cost about
seventy-five cents; at same time get a small piece of
putty, same color as the stain; the man at the paint
shop where you get your stain, will color the putty
for you. With this colored putty fill up all holes made
by nail heads or screws.</p>

<p>If you are on good terms with a painter, he will
likely enough lend you a couple of brushes. If you
have to buy them, get one large and one small, costing
from fifty to seventy-five cents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>See that the surface of the cabinet is free from dust;
to make sure, wipe inside and out with soft cloth.
Stir the stain up thoroughly from the bottom of the
can with a small stick; repeat this frequently, otherwise
your stain will not be even colored.</p>

<p>With the large brush put on one coat of stain, remembering
always to draw the brush in <em>one direction</em>
and <em>with the grain</em> of the wood.</p>

<p>Put on as evenly as possible; always pat and press
the brush on the side of the can so it will not drip,
otherwise your stain will be streaky. Let this dry
thoroughly for half a day where no dust is flying.
Prepare the size by melting glue in warm water, add
boiling water till thin and smooth, then add a spoonful
of lime water.</p>

<p>Clean the stain brush in warm water and use it for
the size; one coat put on evenly so as to cover every
part stained; clean your brush again in warm water.
Next day put on the varnish; this requires especial
care. It must be a <em>thin</em>, <em>even</em> coat if you wish to
have a creditable job. It is worth taking pains. It
ought to have a day or two to dry in a place where
no dust is flying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>If you are in a hurry, you can use shellac, which
dries almost instantly; but for this very reason, is
much harder to put on well. I always prefer the
coach varnish.</p>

<p>The small brush is handy for the shelves and
corners.</p>

<p>Make a neat job, and don’t let the size or the varnish
get into lumps in the corners.</p>

<h2><a name="VIII_CURTAIN_POLES" id="VIII_CURTAIN_POLES"></a>VIII.&mdash;CURTAIN POLES.</h2>


<p class="drop-capt">PERHAPS this paper will sound more like upholstery
than carpentry, but there is carpentry in
it, and of the sort too that boy-carpenters can do just
as well as men-carpenters, and make changes in
accordance to the requirement of the windows
for which they are planning, the material at hand
and their own taste. Always remember that mere
rules for such work are not enough, and that you
must keep on hand a good supply of <em>common sense</em>.</p>

<p>If you should look in the yellow-covered Farmer’s
Almanac, hanging by a loop in the chimney corner,
you’d see, “About this time look out for clearing
weather;” that means clearing out and cleaning up
and setting the house in order inside, as well as old
Mother Earth outside: what our mothers call
“spring cleaning.” Curtains come down to be
washed and put up again, and it’s a good time, too, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
put up curtains where there never have been any, for
nothing makes a room look more homelike and inviting
than drapery of some sort or other, no matter
how simple.</p>

<p>It used to be the fashion to tack curtains across
the top of a window-frame with a strip of stamped
brass-work called a cornice, or a bit of bright chintz,
or turkey red, or something like a ruffle, to cover the
edges; but curtain poles, or rods and rings, are the
fashion now. They are prettier than the other things,
and have one advantage beside: the curtains can be
pushed quite to one side when one wants more air or
light, and can be drawn close together again when
more perfect shade is needed.</p>

<p>Suppose you want to fix up your own room to look
pretty and not cost very much. I found it good fun
to make something useful out of something other
people had discarded as useless. I’ll tell you how I
made my room look cosey, and what I did it with. It
had just one window, a half-dormer as they call it,
and looked to the west, out over the hills; but the
sun shone in very bright and hot in the afternoon,
and I had to have a dark shade which I fitted myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
from one that had belonged to a larger window.
It kept the sun out, but it was not pretty, and I was
determined to have some draperies. Of course I
could not make curtains, for a boy is more handy
with a hammer than a needle; but when mother
found what I was up to, she said she’d give me the
curtains if I could do all the rest. They were very
simple, just cream-colored Nottingham lace, and cost
$1.00. They might have been made of unbleached
strainer cloth at six cents a yard, with a ruffle, if this
had been for your mother or sister who didn’t mind
sewing; but it is the pole I mean to tell you about.</p>

<p>I’m sure to look at it you would never guess what
that pole was, or where I got it.</p>

<p>Up in the attic, in one corner, I found an old
United States map, so old, so out of date that as a
map it had been useless for years and years, for it
was printed when the State of Ohio was “way out
West.” The map used to hang in grandfather’s
library half a century ago. It had black rollers with
acorn knobs on the ends. I thought right away that
the smooth slender pole would be just the thing for a
curtain pole if I could get the map off without splitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
the roller which was of soft pine stained black.
A sharp knife and a little care did it. One of
the knobs was easily loosened. Then I measured
carefully over my window and cut the pole the right
length and fitted the knobs smoothly into place.
A little sandpaper and a coat of varnish made
my stained pine roller look like ebony. But what
was I to do for curtain rings! The pole was too
slender for the heavy wooden rings sold by the
dozen at the upholsterer’s; besides I did not want to
spend any money. Back to the attic I went and
rummaged in what we call the “trumpery box,” full of
the odds and ends that accumulate in an old house.
Among a lot of brass knobs and hooks and hinges, I
came across a lot of dingy metal rings tied together
with a bit of stout string. The rings were about
an inch and a half across; I could not tell what the
rings were made of, they were so black, but I thought
a good washing would bring out the complexion, so I
put the rings into a bath of ammonia and soda, which
soon showed that under the black coating was something
very much like brass. A stiff brush and a little
fine pummice gave me a dozen glittering rings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
six for each curtain. I divided the curtains evenly;
with strong thread fastened the rings in place on the
upper edge of each curtain and slipped them on
to the pole. Two inches from the ends of the pole I
screwed the little rings through which the cord had
passed when the map was hung. A little hook at
each end of the upper window frame served to hang
my pole, which of course was very light, but heavy
enough for muslin or lace. In the same “trumpery
box” I found two brass knobs (door knobs, I guess
they were). I screwed one of these each side of the
window and looped back my curtains. There was
my window, as new-fashioned or as old-fashioned as
you choose to call it, but very pretty and inexpensive.</p>

<p>There are few old houses in the country that
would not give at least as much to work with as I
had. The old rollers on old-fashioned paper shades,
such as you will find in lots of up-country attics,
would make just as good poles stained and varnished.
Even the acorn caps are not essential, for many of the
most fashionable <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">portieres</i> and curtain poles, nowadays,
especially those of bamboo, have no caps at all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
on the ends: only then you put a screw in at right
angles, to keep the end ring from coming off.</p>

<p>That was the first curtain pole that I put up. The
next room I tried my hand on had a bay with three
windows, and was harder to manage, but it did not
cost very much after all. I saw an advertisement of
an odd lot of curtain poles with rings and brackets
complete for seventy-five cents apiece. Since then I
have seen them advertised for sixty cents, which is
cheaper than you can get the wood and turn them for
yourself.</p>

<p>I found that two poles would do for the three windows,
for the side windows were narrow, and half a
pole was enough for each. I only wanted two ends
instead of the four that belonged with the poles, so a
trifle was allowed, enough to give me some extra rings
and two extra brackets.</p>

<p>The first thing to do was to get the angle of the
bay: this I did with some mathematical instruments,
but you might not have those handy, and this way
will give it near enough. Take a good-sized piece of
stiff paper (stout wrapping paper will do), lay a
straight edge on the floor against the mop-board<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
of the middle window, and fold the end of the paper
to exactly fit the side mop-board, something like this.
Then fold the straight edges together and you will
have the angle shown in the dotted line.</p>

<p>Measure length of middle and side windows and cut
the poles at the angle shown by the folded paper: a
few brads will secure the slanting ends when they are
neatly put together.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a name="figp068" id="figp068"></a><img src="images/i_068.jpg" width="400" height="108" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The brackets that come with these cheap poles are
iron spikes bent up at one end. Two are used for
each pole; they are driven into the wall about four or
five inches from the ends of the poles, and the poles
rest on the brackets; of course the joined corners
count as ends, and are supported in the same way.
Some prefer to put ring-headed screws into the poles
and slip the rings over the ends of the spikes; and
more expensive poles have brass “cup brackets”
which of course are ornamental, but also expensive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>The wooden rings have ring screws on which to
fasten the curtains. The number used is a matter of
taste and depends upon the stuff the curtains are
made of, the size of the folds you want, and the number
of rings you have. Five or six do very well for a
yard-wide curtain. Be sure and divide evenly; put
one ring at each upper corner and the rest as they
come; a few stitches with coarse thread will secure
them, or better still, an inch of tape slipped through
the ring and fastened by the doubled ends on to the
edge of the cloth. You can buy curtain hooks if you
like, and have them sewed on. These are something
like big dress hooks: the advantage is, that when you
want to take curtains down you just unhook them
from the rings without taking the poles down at all.</p>

<p>I know a boy who made a pretty pair of curtain-poles
out of two straight, slender beech saplings; he
twisted rings out of stout wire and wound them with
crossway strips of dark cloth. For muslin curtains,
loops of bright ribbons instead of rings would be
prettier still on such rustic poles.</p>

<p>Would you like to know what curtains went on to
my sixty-cent poles? They are very “æsthetic” in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
color, but are just soft Canton flannel at a shilling a
yard. The centre of olive, the sides dark crimson with
bands between of darker olive. These are looped
away on either side with bands made of the flannel and
underneath are full curtains of six-cent scrim, (unbleached).</p>

<p>But curtain-making belongs to the girls, so having
told you how to make the poles and put them up, I
will leave the rest to them.</p>

<h2><a name="IX_BOOK-REST" id="IX_BOOK-REST"></a>IX.&mdash;BOOK-REST.</h2>


<p class="drop-capt">PERHAPS you would like now to make something
useful and pretty for your father or your big
brother, so I will try to tell you how to make a book-rest
like one I made myself for Christmas. It has
no fancy carving about it, but is made (as you can see
by the illustration) of straight pieces.</p>

<p>The directions for finding the angles might be given
mathematically, so that you could get them for yourself
with a little figuring, but it will be easier practically
to find the angles in the way I describe, and
they will be accurate enough for this piece of work.</p>

<p>For the book-rest you must buy some planed whitewood
which is preferable to any other on account
of staining. A piece eighteen inches long, twelve
inches wide and one half inch thick, will be enough;
it will cost about ten cents.</p>

<p>Lengthwise with chalk-line mark off eleven strips
five eighths inch wide; cut them with splitting-saw and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
plane, the sides cut with fore-plane, making each
strip <span class="smcap">JUST</span> one half inch in breadth as well as thickness.</p>

<p>We will begin with the uprights for the front.</p>

<p>Take one of these strips, square one end: then
measure a little over one half inch down the stick,
and with try-square make a continuous line around
the stick.</p>

<p>Find the centre of the end just squared by drawing
diagonals, and then either with block-plane
or knife, point the stick by putting the
edge of knife on the continuous line on one
of the faces of the square, and directing the
blade toward the centre of end; a steady,
firm pressure will give a good bevel. Finish
the other three sides in the same way, and
you will have a pyramid with square base for one end
of your stick: cut the stick off square thirteen inches
from the point. Finish two more sticks in the same
way, and you will have your three front uprights.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 75px;">
<a name="figp072" id="figp072"></a><img src="images/i_072.jpg" width="75" height="211" alt="" />
<div class="caption">FIG. 1.</div>
</div>

<p>Now take another piece; square one end as nicely
as possible (everything depends in this job on the
neatness and accuracy of your work), measure seven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
and five eighths inches from squared end; cut off and
square: you will have a stick seven and one half
inches long. Make another like this from the piece
left. These pieces we will mark <i>A</i>: they are the
short uprights in diagram. Now cut two pieces
twelve and one half inches long: square both ends;
find exact middle, measure one fourth inch in each
direction from middle and draw lines with square
<em>across</em> the stick. Right and left on the side faces
(<em>not</em> the one underneath), draw lines parallel with top
face one fourth inch from it. These last lines show
how deep you are to saw on the first two lines with
cross-cut saw. With chisel remove the little piece
one half by one half by one fourth. Take care not
to cut the stick deeper than the lines indicate. The
sticks will look like <a href="#figp072">fig. 1</a>. These are the cross bars,
<i>BB</i>.</p>

<p>From another stick cut three pieces six inches
long: square both ends; these are marked <i>CCC</i>; two
belong to the back, and one for the front connecting
<i>CC</i>. From short pieces left cut two pieces two and
three fourths inches long, of course squaring the
ends: these are <i>DD</i>, and go at side of front.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>For uprights of back cut two pieces ten inches long:
square ends. On a board or piece of paper mark
on a line two points three and one
half inches apart. From the right-hand
point draw a perpendicular, the
line connecting the two points being
the base of a triangle. Lay one ten-inch
stick from the left hand point
to the perpendicular, making the hypotenuse
of a right-angled triangle.
You will readily see how much of a
bevel is required to make the lower
end set firmly. It will probably be about one eighth
of an inch; make the same bevel on the other ten-inch
piece: these we will mark <i>EE</i> (the uprights for
the back). Bevel the lower ends of the three-pointed
sticks (the uprights for front) in the same way. (<i>See
base of <a href="#figp074">fig. 2</a>.</i>)</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;">
<a name="figp074" id="figp074"></a><img src="images/i_074.jpg" width="150" height="297" alt="" />
<div class="caption">FIG. 2.</div>
</div>

<p>On one front upright, measure two and three
fourths inches from point on face <i>A</i>: cut out bit one
half by one half by one fourth as in piece <i>B</i>. Repeat
at eight inches; again at ten and five eighths inches
from point of stick. This completes middle upright.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>Now to return to pieces <i>EE</i>. On a board or paper
mark in line three points three and one half inches
apart. Hold beveled end of pointed upright on
point one, so that a point <i>Y</i> ten inches from bevel
will be perpendicular to point two. Stand bevel end
of <i>E</i> on point three, so that the other end will rest
against point <i>Y</i>. You will then see the bevel needed on
upper end of <i>E</i> to
make it fit against
point <i>Y</i>. It will be
about an inch long.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<a name="figp075" id="figp075"></a><img src="images/i_075.jpg" width="300" height="259" alt="" />
<div class="caption">FIG. 3.</div>
</div>

<p>Treat the other
<i>E</i> in the same way,
taking care that
both bevels start
from same face of
stick. Square end of new stick: cut off six inches
and square again. At point three inches from end
cut out bit one half by one half by one fourth, as in <i>B</i>.
This is the stick <i>F</i>.</p>

<p>Cut two sticks ten inches long: square ends. These
are <i>GG</i>.</p>

<p>The pieces are all cut out; now of course you had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
more whitewood than these measures, but it is so
cheap it seemed best to allow for mistakes, and the
spoiling of two or three sticks in cutting bevels, etc.
The bits left always come handy.</p>

<p>In putting the parts together you must be very
careful. You will need some one-inch brads and
some seven-sixteenths or three eighth ones also, and
about two feet of brass spring wire, two French
screws one inch long (slim ones), and two five eighths
inch ones.</p>

<p>Take first the pointed piece for the middle of
front: the one with the squares cut out of it: fit one
of the <i>B’s</i> into the upper place and the other into the
lower one. Put piece <i>F</i> into the middle slot; put
two brads through each piece (<i>BBF</i>) and into the
pointed one. Turn the whole over so the face <i>A</i>
is down.</p>

<p>Take two pieces marked <i>A</i>; with inch-brads fasten
pieces <i>D</i> endwise, so that upper face of <i>D</i> will be
two and one eighth inches from end of <i>A</i>.</p>

<p>Place one <i>A</i> between the two <i>B’s</i> on the right
of pointed stick with <i>D</i> pointing to the right; you
will find that the end of <i>F</i> touches <i>A</i> at a point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
two and one eighth inches from the bottom, so that
<i>F</i> and <i>D</i> divide <i>A</i> plus one half inch (eight inches)
into thirds.</p>

<p>Place the other <i>A</i> and <i>D</i> facing just opposite on
the other side of pointed stick. You will find that
the ends of the <i>A’s</i> touch the <i>B’s</i> at a point half-way
between the end of <i>B</i> and the pointed piece. Secure
in position with inch-brads.</p>

<p>Place one of the other pointed sticks to the right,
the other to the left of ends of <i>B</i> and <i>D</i>, and fasten
so that the end of upper <i>B</i> is two and one half inches
from point, and <i>D</i> two and one eighth inches from
upper <i>B</i> and lower <i>B</i> <em>slightly</em> over two inches from
bottom of bevel. In placing these two pointed pieces
<em>be sure</em> and have the face <i>a</i> (<a href="#figp074"><i>fig. 2</i></a>) down.</p>

<p>Now for the back. Take the pieces marked <i>E</i>;
measure two and five eighth inches from upper ends;
fasten one of the pieces <i>C</i> by the ends to these
points, and the second <i>C</i> at a point a <em>little</em> over two
inches from bottom.</p>

<p>Fasten upper beveled ends of the <i>E’s</i> to backs of
points <i>x</i> (<i>see picture</i>) with short brass screws and a
couple of brads.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>Next take pieces <i>G</i>, and measure two and three
fourth inches from end: bore holes large enough to
admit long screws; with brads fasten third <i>C</i> at points
one and one half inches from ends of <i>G</i>, and one and
one fourth inch from holes. (This is to support the
book.) Then screw <i>G</i>’s directly under <i>B</i> and <i>A</i>, the
long ends directed backward. You will find the
seven-inch ends will touch the lower part of pieces <i>E</i>
about one half inch from bottom. Fasten with brads.</p>

<p>These two pieces (<i>G</i>) serve to keep the back from
spreading away from front and make the rest strong
enough to support quite a heavy book.</p>

<p>This is really a very simple thing to make, for the
lines are all straight, and if you are careful in cutting,
fitting and joining, you will feel paid for the trouble.</p>

<h2><a name="X_BOOK-REST_Continued" id="X_BOOK-REST_Continued"></a>X.&mdash;BOOK-REST. (<i>Continued.</i>)</h2>


<p class="drop-capt">YOU now
have the
book-rest all
put together
ready for finishing.
The first thing now to do is to sandpaper
it. For this you must buy some (o) or (oo)
sandpaper, and go over the whole thing, being
careful not to round the corners. You can accomplish
this by stretching a piece of sandpaper
over one of the little bits that remained
after cutting: this will make a flat, firm surface,
and will not be so liable to round the edges as if
stretched over your thumb.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 350px;">
<a name="figp079" id="figp079"></a><img src="images/i_079.jpg" width="350" height="343" alt="" />
<div class="caption">FIG. 1.</div>
</div>

<p>Before staining, you must make the brass springs
to hold the leaves back.</p>

<p>Cut six and one half inches of your spring wire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
(which should be about one sixteenth of an inch in
diameter.) At a point five eighths of an inch from
end, bend the wire into a right angle; two and one
fourth inches from that point give the wire a turn
round a small nail, or piece of telegraph wire (you
cannot turn it evenly with your fingers alone); this
is to give the wire a spring, and will enable you to lift
the end of the wire on to the leaves of the book.
Now turn the end of the wire in so as to make
a rounded end. It will then look like <a href="#figp079"><i>fig. 1</i></a>.</p>

<p>Make another spring exactly like this one: then
cut off a piece five and one half inches long, bend to
a right angle at a point five eighths of an inch from
end. Then at a point two inches from angle, give
the wire a turn as in the other set, and turn the end
in. Make a second one like this of the remaining
piece of wire.</p>

<p>To fasten these springs on to the rest, you must
bore a hole one-sixteenth of an inch in diameter
through the sides of the two <em>end uprights</em>, at a point
just below the end of piece <i>D</i>. Insert the five
eighth inch ends of the larger set of springs into
these holes, from the outside. You will find that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
can lay the springs back when not in use, and that
you can turn them out and lift the ends over the
edges of your book, so as to keep the pages down
when you do need to use them.</p>

<p>The smaller set can be fastened in the same way
under lower <i>B</i> or under <i>G</i> if you prefer, at a point
near the lower ends of <i>A A</i>.</p>

<p>If you are going to stain the book-rest, it is better
to do it before fastening in the springs.</p>

<p>I think ebony stain goes best, and as you can
make it yourself, it would perhaps be cheaper.</p>

<p>First you must get some logwood chips (about a
teacupful); after boiling them in a pint of water for
an hour or so, apply with an old brush (not the chips,
but the decoction you have made by boiling the chips!).
You can put on two or three coats of this, letting
it dry each time.</p>

<p>The next part will perhaps be the hardest. Get
some iron rust or old iron filings, put these in strong
vinegar or acetic acid and let it stand a day or two;
if by this time the liquid is not of a reddish-black
color, add more iron rust.</p>

<p>After the two or three coats of logwood, your wood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
will be of a dark yellow color, but this will immediately
turn to a fine black when you apply the iron.
Only one coat of this is needful, because it does not
soak in. You might try the logwood and the iron on
a small bit of wood first, and then you will see if
the solution of iron is strong enough for a good
black.</p>

<p>When the book-rest is <em>perfectly</em> dry, rub on some
thin shellac with a soft cloth: this will make the dull
finish now considered so desirable.</p>

<p>This book-rest is very convenient to use round the
house at home, and is, as you have seen, very easy
to make: but it as an awkward thing to pack away in
a trunk if you are going into the country, for instance,
or are travelling.</p>

<p>You may like to make another, if you have been
successful with this one, and this time you can make
it with hinges, so as to fold up compactly, by making
the following alterations:</p>

<p>The front will be the same and the back also, with
the exception of the uprights <i>E E</i>, being hinged instead
of screwed on to upper <i>B</i>.</p>

<p>The two <i>G’s</i> must have a one fourth inch hole bored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
one fourth of an inch from the back end, and a corresponding
one bored through <i>E</i> about an inch from
the bottom; these holes are for
pins, on which the <i>G’s</i> may turn.</p>

<p>Instead of the six-inch <i>C</i>
which joins the two <i>G’s</i> at a
point one and one half inches
from outer end, there should be
two pieces seven inches long
fastened with brads, at points
respectively three inches and six
and one half inches from outer
ends of <i>G</i>. The piece six and
one half inches from end <em>can</em> be
left out&mdash;though it looks neater with it&mdash;but
the back will shut closer without it.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 150px;">
<a name="figp083" id="figp083"></a><img src="images/i_083.jpg" width="150" height="353" alt="" />
<div class="caption">FIG. 2.</div>
</div>

<p>Now put the peg through the <i>G’s</i> and into the
<i>E’s</i>.</p>

<p>Draw the back of the book-rest from the front, put
ends of <i>G’s</i> through the spaces bounded by pieces
<i>A</i>, <i>B</i> and <i>D</i>, and you will find that the <i>G’s</i> rest
in the corners made by <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>.</p>

<p>When you want to shut up the book-rest, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
must draw the <i>G’s</i> out, and turn them away from
front on to the back of the <i>E’s</i>, and then shut the
<i>E’s</i> up on to the <i>A’s</i> as in <a href="#figp083">figure</a>.</p>

<p>I don’t think this quite as pretty as the fixed
book-rest, and there are of course other ways of
changing the original plan which would be more
ornamental; but this is very easy and will answer
the purpose. You will find it good fun and good
practice to experiment on changes in any of the
designs given, after you have mastered the simple
forms and the plain directions given in these papers.</p>

<h2><a name="XI_A_BED_TABLE" id="XI_A_BED_TABLE"></a>XI.&mdash;A BED TABLE.</h2>


<p class="drop-capt">THE accompanying <a href="#figp086">figure</a> shows you a very useful
but rather peculiar piece of furniture quite
simple to make; if you are ever ill in bed yourself or
any one in the family is obliged to lie in bed and
have meals brought to them, I think you will say it is
a handy thing to have instead of a waiter that joggles
and tips on one’s lap in the bed, instead of even a
table at the side of the bed that compels one to
twist round uncomfortably in order to reach.</p>

<p>It explains itself, almost; but a few directions and
dimensions will help you.</p>

<p>As you can see, it is a tray with legs to set over the
lap in bed, with a rim to keep things from sliding off,
and is light enough to be carried by the side handles;
a tempting breakfast for the invalid can be arranged
neatly upon it instead of a waiter.</p>

<p>It can be made of any kind of wood, but black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
walnut is as pretty as any and enough can be bought
for it, for about fifty cents.</p>

<p>You will need two boards, each two feet long; one
should be one foot wide and one half inch thick,
the other one and a half foot wide and one half inch
thick.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="figp086" id="figp086"></a><img src="images/i_086.jpg" width="500" height="369" alt="" />
<div class="caption">BED TABLE.</div>
</div>

<p>Take the first one; plane nicely, being careful to
have the ends and edges square. Set this aside for
the top of tray.</p>

<p>Plain one edge of second piece (the one and one
half feet wide); with splitting saw cut off strips twenty-four
inches long by four inches wide: square<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
ends and plane edges of piece left. Measure one
foot from end, square and cut off. You will have two
pieces alike for the ends or legs, and one strip two
feet long, four inches wide, for back.</p>

<p>Round off one edge of top (the piece two feet long
by one foot wide) with small plane, and sandpaper
smooth. Take two side pieces; find points nine
inches from bottom and respectively four and eight
inches from side of leg; bore holes with largest bits,
split out piece between, enlarge and smooth with
gouge or knife to fit the hand. These are to slip the
fingers through to hold the tray.</p>

<p>Draw a line parallel with, and ten inches from, bottom
of legs and fasten one leg on either end of the
two foot by one foot piece, using three one inch
screws for each leg.</p>

<p>Fit the back piece neatly on to square edge of top
and fasten with four screws; put a screw on upper
corner of each of the sides, through into end of back
to make it steadier.</p>

<p>If the corners of the sides are rounded as in picture,
it will look a little better.</p>

<p>You can make this bed table even more useful by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
attaching a simple book rest which will be a great
comfort to an invalid who is able to read yet finds it
fatiguing to hold a book.</p>

<p>Cut two pieces one quarter inch thick, one wide and
seven inches long, and one piece nine inches long;
one half inch from bottom of the two seven inch
pieces, bore holes large enough for seven-eighths
inch screws to play in.</p>

<p>One half from ends of nine inch piece, make some
smaller holes, and also two holes one inch from top of
back (on inside) and eight inches apart.</p>

<p>Screw ends of seven inch pieces into these holes
and the nine inch piece into the other ends of the
seven inch pieces; of course the screws must play
easily. When not in use the rack will fold over and
lie inside the back as shown by dotted lines.</p>

<p>To keep the book from slipping forward insert
two movable pegs about three and a half inches
apart in front of middle of back.</p>

<h2><a name="XII_CABINET" id="XII_CABINET"></a>XII.&mdash;CABINET.</h2>


<p class="drop-capt">I HAVE often been asked to describe a “Cabinet
for Specimens,” such as I made for minerals.
It would be equally good for shells, eggs, coins, or
even for a bookcase. The shelves hold the specimens
protected from dust with glass doors, and from meddling
fingers with a lock and key. The cupboard (or
drawer if preferable) below holds duplicates useful in
making exchanges, and the needful tools for the specialty
which interests you.</p>

<p>The cabinet of course can be made of black walnut
or any other hard wood, but for lightness as well as
cheapness I used pine (stained) and put in a back of
dark-brown cambric instead of wood, the cambric
costing fifteen or twenty cents, where the wood would
cost nearly a dollar and a half.</p>

<p>I can’t give you close estimates about lumber
either as to price or lengths, because at different mills<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
boards vary greatly in dimensions, and values at the
West or in Maine are unlike those in cities. I will
therefore describe my own, feeling sure that by this
time if you have made all the other articles in the
series you can alter the pattern I give you, or follow
it accurately, according to the purpose you have in
view.</p>

<p>My cabinet fits easily in an alcove six feet, six
inches high, and four feet, six inches wide; and is
large enough to hold an interesting collection. For
convenience in cutting, the seven boards I used were
selected according to the following dimensions:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
A&mdash;12 feet by 12 inches.<br />
B&mdash;6 feet by 10 inches.<br />
C&mdash;8&frac12; feet by 12 inches.<br />
D&mdash;12 feet by 12 inches.<br />
H&mdash;4 feet by 13 inches,<br />
and 2 boards for shelves 8 feet long by 1 foot wide.<br />
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If possible, get three-fourths-inch board, as it is
both lighter and cheaper, but inch-board is often
easier to get and my measurements are for that.
Get it all as clear as possible.</p>

<p>Besides the boards you will need two pieces of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
two-inch moulding six feet long, and two pieces
of three-fourths-inch about eleven feet long, to
hold the glass in the doors, and three pair of hinges;
also lock and key if
you desire all to be
secure.</p>

<p>Take <i>A</i>, divide in two,
plane edges and square
ends for sides.</p>

<p>Take <i>C</i>, cut two
boards, each four feet
two inches long, and
one foot wide, for top
and bottom.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">
<a name="figp091" id="figp091"></a><img src="images/i_091.jpg" width="250" height="337" alt="" />
<div class="caption">THE CABINET.</div>
</div>

<p>From <i>B</i> cut two pieces that shall be six feet long,
and four inches (for sides of door casing), then
from remainder cut strip three and one half feet by
one inch, to go behind lower moulding for hinges
of <i>E</i>.</p>

<p>From board <i>H</i> (which is four feet by thirteen
inches) cut out block at <em>each end of one edge</em>, three
inches long by one wide.</p>

<p>Nail <i>CC</i> on to top and bottom of <i>AA</i>, taking care<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
to put top and bottom (<i>CC</i>) <em>on</em> and not between uprights
<i>AA</i>.</p>

<p>At point nine inches from lower <i>C</i>, nail board <i>H</i>,
with the projection facing outward. On each side on
front nail strips <i>BB</i>. You will find they fit into cuts
made in <i>H</i>.</p>

<p>Nail the three and one half feet strip close to
bottom <i>C</i> between <i>BB</i>.</p>

<p>From remainder of board <i>B</i> cut piece three and
one half feet long; with splitting-saw divide this into
two boards, one eight inches, one four inches wide.
Nail the four-inch piece directly under <i>C</i>, between the
<i>BB</i>. This finishes the front for the doors.</p>

<p>Now for the mouldings: from one of the two-inch
strips cut piece four feet, four inches long; cut ends
at angle of forty-five degrees; cut two pieces one foot
three inches long: have right-hand end of one and
left-hand end of other cut at angles of forty-five degrees,
i. e., one half of a right angle. Cut a second
similar set of mouldings, nailing one set to top, the
other to bottom of cabinet.</p>

<p>The piece three and one half feet by eight inches
is a kind of door, which is hinged to the strip behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
the moulding at the bottom. In my cabinet I have it
for a cupboard, as I said before, but you can put in a
drawer in its place if you prefer.</p>

<p>For the doors, cut from <i>H</i> four pieces four feet, ten
inches long by three inches wide, and four pieces one
foot, nine inches long by three inches wide.</p>

<p>The best way of putting this together is of course
to mortise it. To do this, draw lines at each end of
one of the long pieces on the edge one fourth inch
from each side; then draw lines <em>across</em> the edge at
points three fourths and two and one fourth inches
from end.</p>

<p>This rectangle must now be cut out. Bore three one
half inch holes one and one half inches deep: then
with chisel split out the remaining wood and smooth
as nicely as possible. Repeat this on all the long
pieces.</p>

<p>To make the tenons or tongues which fit the mortises,
measure one and one fourth inches from ends
of short sticks, and with try-square draw line all
round the stick. On sides of stick saw in one fourth
inch deep; on edges saw three fourths inch deep.
Then, parallel to sides, draw lines one fourth inch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
from sides of stick on the end, and two more lines
three fourths of inch from and parallel with edges of
stick. Place edge of chisel just outside of lines and
chip off the little blocks, gradually shaving the tenons
down to the lines.</p>

<p>If this is nicely done, the tenons will fit into the
mortises so that the side edges and ends of the four
long sticks will fit snugly on to the short ones. Put
a peg through long and short pieces at the tenons to
keep them from coming apart.</p>

<p>This can be done in another way that is also somewhat
easier, by cutting from the sides at the ends of
the pieces squares three inches by three inches by
one half inch and screwing together.</p>

<p>If you have only one light of glass to each door,
there will be no need of a cross-piece,
so you will simply have to put the moulding
round on the inside of the door
frames. If you have smaller panes, you
will need the crossbars.</p>

<div class="caption">TENON AND
MORTISE.</div>
</div>

<p>For the four shelves you will require you must cut
the two eight-foot boards into four, and make cleats
to support them. These are merely narrow strips<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
of wood nailed on inside of <i>HH</i> (at the height desired)
on which the ends of the shelves rest. The
staining is done by the rule given in a former
paper, and the hinges and lock are set as in the tool
cabinet.</p>

<p>About four yards of dark cambric tacked on the
back will finish a neat, simple, but serviceable cabinet
like the illustration.</p>

<h2><a name="XIII_A_BOYS_CATCHALL" id="XIII_A_BOYS_CATCHALL"></a>XIII.&mdash;A BOY’S “CATCHALL.”</h2>


<p class="drop-capt">THERE is no better way for a boy to spend his
evenings, half-holidays, and vacations, than
in making some useful and pretty articles of furniture
for his own room, providing he has an aptitude for
such work, and the mechanical ingenuity and natural
patience to do it with neatness and accuracy. Yet a
boy should not&mdash;if he takes pleasure in such work&mdash;become
discouraged if his first attempts are not
wholly attended by success, as no success comes
without perseverance; and perseverance, if the love
for the work be not wanting, will inevitably bring
its own reward.</p>

<p>The average boy is not usually blessed with overmuch
room in which to bestow his many treasures&mdash;his
bats, balls and marbles, his collection of butterflies
and bugs, relics of many a pleasant tramp through
field and wood, and last, but far from least important,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
the treasured books of tale and adventure, so dear to
the heart of a genuine boy; therefore the little case
or cabinet of the illustration has been contrived, for
his own making, as a resting-place for all these and
more, and to prove the happy truth of the old adage,
“A place for everything, and everything in its place.”</p>

<p>It may be constructed of nicely-selected pine, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
this is easily obtained, is cheap, and any little mistake
will not entail too much expense if the work has to
be done again, and also it is easily worked, and
takes a beautiful golden color when “filled,” and
finished with shellac. Pains must be taken not to
mar the wood with tool-marks. To make a nice piece
of work, you will not use any nails, but put the case
together with dowels, screws, and glue.</p>

<p>Now look over the drawings together. <i>Sketch No.
1</i> shows the completed case as it should look when
finished and in place. The first section, <i>A</i>, (<i>Sketch
No. 2</i>) is a fair-sized box with lifting cover, and a shelf
beneath. This will be found handy for many odds
and ends of boyish treasures too cumbersome to
be stored away in drawers and boxes. <i>Section B</i>
contains the specimen, or butterfly case, with a row
of small drawers below, these drawers being handy
receptacles for marbles, tops, twine, or like odds and
ends that make a troublesome litter when thrown
together in a large drawer. Two large drawers below
these, and the shelf, will find their uses, without doubt.
<i>Section C</i> has a couple of shelves for books, with
storage room for bats, hockey sticks, etc., below; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
in one corner is a small box large enough to hold
two or three balls; outside of this, as the other plans
will show, is a receptacle for a foot-ball, made of
bent wire. This, if not a desirable addition, may be
left off.</p>

<p>Having looked our case over in a general way, let
us now go into the details of construction and finish.
In <i>Sketch No. 2</i> will be found all the general measurements.
The figuring and lettering on the <i>Detail
Sketch</i> all refer to this drawing. We will first get
out the stock for the side-pieces of the various sections,
four in number, and two of them&mdash;those belonging
to <i>Section B</i>&mdash;of exactly the same size and
shape. These should be of one and one fourth inch
stock, and of the dimensions given in <i>Detail Sketch
No. 3</i>. Mark out carefully the simple outline indicated
for each piece, using a piece of charcoal, so the
line may be easily wiped out and corrected if unsatisfactory.
Go over the corrected outline with a soft
pencil to preserve them, and then saw them out.
This must be done with care, to keep the edges even
and true, using either a draw tool or small saw on
the finer outlines.</p>

</div>

<p>The half-trefoil on side of <i>Section A</i> at the bottom
should be drawn with a compass, or scribing tool,
and cut with a hand scroll-saw; and the simple pattern
on the sides should first be marked out with a
compass, the larger hole carefully cut out with a sharp
tool to the depth of one fourth inch. The smaller
holes, surrounding it, bore out to about the same
depth with a small auger-bit. The straight line decoration
on sides of <i>Sections B</i> and <i>C</i> are first neatly
lined with a pencil, and then cut with a sharp tool,
one fourth inch wide, and about as deep. The cover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
of <i>Section A</i> should be of seven eighths inch stock,
and should project fully an inch over the side and
front. The back piece, on which the hinges are fastened,
should be two and one half inches wide.
This will allow ample room for the back board, and
give to the cover, when open, sufficient slant to lean
easily against the wall. This piece should be well
glued and doweled into place, and two neat brass
hinges set in, to hold the cover. The bottom of box
and bottom shelf of this same section are of same
thickness as top, firmly doweled and glued into place.
The front panel is of same thickness, and cut to fit
exactly into place, doweled and glued. The small
jig-saw patterns at bottom of <i>Sketches No. 8</i>, <i>9</i>, <i>10</i>,
are cut from one half inch stock, and glued on firmly.
<i>Section A</i> is now ready to attach to the side piece
of <i>Section B</i>. This must be neatly and firmly done
with dowels and glue.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 443px;">

<div class="caption">SKETCH NO. 3.</div>
</div>

<p>In <i>Section B</i> first get out the top, centre and bottom
shelves, as well as the narrow strip division for
the drawers; these last need not run back more
than three inches, excepting for the row of small
drawers. This division should run entirely from front<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
to back, the same as the shelves. The thickness of
all the shelving is the same throughout. Having
framed together our sides with the centre and bottom
shelves, and drawer partitions, next place the two
narrow uprights, on which the doors are to be hung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>,
in position. These are one half inch wide and firmly
doweled and glued into sides; the doors are hung
with simple brass hinges and made to lap one over the
other on one fourth inch rebate, and shutting against
an upright post about three fourths inch square.
Glue a strip one inch wide and one half inch thick
around the sides and back piece, for the top to rest
upon and be fastened to, by one fourth inch dowels,
and glued; this strip should, for further security, be
fastened by a number of small screws. Space will not
allow the details of construction of drawers; but if
the lad will look at any well-made drawer, he will easily
find out for himself.</p>

<p>We have already got out the side for the book
shelves and bat holder, <i>Section C</i>, and have only to
dowel and glue shelves firmly into place, put the
back boards in position, having got them out the size
and shape shown by <i>Sketches 7 and 8</i>.</p>

<p>Now our case is well framed together and it only remains
for us to finish various small details. After
fitting a one fourth inch shelf into the specimen case
midway, the next move is to line the whole of the
specimen case and the two long drawers beneath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
with thin, flat pieces of cork about one eighth inch in
thickness. First apply to the whole surface to be
covered, a thin coating of hot glue, fitting in the
piece of cork while the glue is hot; rub well into
place, and apply an even pressure, to be left until
the glue is thoroughly “set;” when this is done
cover all the cork with nice white paper, applied with
flour paste. Frame up the door as shown in <i>Sketch
No. 12</i>, of one half inch stock, setting the glass in from
the front into a narrow rebate. Then glue a narrow
moulding on the outside to prevent the glass from
falling out. Hang the door with brass hinges and
fit a small lock into place; then dowel neatly into
place the under brackets, <i>Nos. 9</i>, <i>10</i>, <i>11</i>, in their
respective positions, place pretty brass pulls on all
the drawers, and the case is nearly ready for finishing.</p>

<p>In the book case <i>Section 6</i>, the simplest way of arranging
the shelves is to bore a row of one fourth inch
holes front and back and at both sides, and fit little
pegs into these for two shelves to rest on. These
may be raised or lowered by changing the positions
of the pegs. Make a little box as shown of one fourth
inch stock, fasten this neatly with small screws into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
the left-hand upper corner of the bat holder under
the lower shelf; this is to hold the base and hockey
balls. The back of the case may be made of narrow
strips of one fourth inch sheathing, held in by screws.</p>

<p>Fill the woodwork thoroughly with a good filler;
Wheeler’s is good. After it is wholly dry, go over the
case with a good coat of white shellac, and when
dry, rub it down carefully with powdered pummice
stone, oil and emery cloth. A second coat of shellac
carefully rubbed down, will result in a rich golden
brown hue, that will improve with age. This case,
when complete, will cover a small space of four feet
nine inches by three feet three inches.</p>

<p>In buying stock, select the best pine for all portions
that will show. Get the stock well planed and smooth
it down.</p>

<p>If made by a carpenter, twenty-five dollars would be
the smallest payable price for a good job, so that the
price named is not at all excessive for a really good
thing.</p>

<p>This case being somewhat elaborate is intended
both in design and instructions here given, for those
boys who have a fair knowledge of construction, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
some ideas as to the best way to set about it; and it
must be borne in mind although pine is soft and easily
worked, it is also easily soiled and injured by tool
marks more readily than the harder woods.</p>

below will be found useful in buying.</p>

<h2><a name="XIV_HOW_TO_BUILD_A_PORTABLE" id="XIV_HOW_TO_BUILD_A_PORTABLE"></a>XIV.&mdash;HOW TO BUILD A PORTABLE
WOODEN TENT.</h2>


<p class="drop-capt">WOODEN tents such as I am about to describe,
are in use by the contractors who are building
the western extensions of the Denver and Rio
Grande Railway in Colorado. There are no towns
there ahead of the railway, and it is necessary to provide
sleeping-quarters, provisions and eating-houses,
for the engineers and road-makers. It is therefore
needful to have a style of building which can be
put up and taken down easily, and, above all, which
shall be capable of transportation over the frightful
mountain roads. The result, it seems to me, might be
useful to bevies of boys, to schoolmasters and pupils,
and to families who camp out every summer for
some considerable time, and really need to take to
the woods a house somewhat better than a cloth tent,
where they can live in warmth and comfort, and
which shall be a cosey headquarters for storing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
supplies, and to which they may return. My
object now is in these papers to instruct our
young home carpenters how during their winter
leisure to get one of these comfortable wooden tents
in complete readiness for summer transportation. It
can be done very cheaply; if you can improve on it,
so much the better. For my part, I have never seen
or heard of the like anywhere else, though I believe
that circus sideshows sometimes have a far more
cumbersome arrangement answering the same purpose.</p>

<p>Boys might club together, not only to own such a
portable house in common, but to build it&mdash;a jolly
way of spending Saturdays in some great wagon-house
or tool-chamber where there is a big workbench and
a good tool-chest.</p>

<p>This movable house consists wholly of wood except
the roof, which is canvas, and the floor, which is dirt,
unless you choose to plank it. It may be made of
any size you see fit, it only being necessary that all
the parts are adjusted to the scale decided upon.
The dimensions I give, however, are measured upon
a plan twelve feet square, because that happened to
be the actual size of the one nearest to me. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
railway men generally join from two to half a dozen
of these together, end to end, making a long and
commodious building. A half-dozen congenial families
could do the same, insuring endless good times
in the forest solitudes. One twelve-foot length is
then known as a “section.” If you would rather
have an oblong figure, make your ends shorter and
reduce the length of your rafters; or, if you don’t
like the pretty low pitch of the roof which my measurements
imply, lengthen your uprights and rafters to
suit your own ideas of the right angle.</p>

<p>Now for my details:</p>

<p>The walls of your tent-house, six feet in height, are
to be made of inch-thick matched flooring twelve feet
long. They should be No. 1 pine, best quality.
Fasten these firmly together, to the width of six feet,
by three dressed cleats, six inches wide, one at each
end and one in the middle, and do this on both sides.
Make three of these platforms, or walls, which will
furnish three sides of your house. For the fourth
side make a similar platform nine feet in length, filling
out the remaining three feet with a door.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<a name="figp112" id="figp112"></a><img src="images/i_112.jpg" width="300" height="281" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 14.</span></div>
</div>

<p>This door swings <em>out</em>, and the hinges should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
very strong, preferably of the kind used on barn doors,
so that it can be
lifted off its hanging
with ease, and
so that the long
shaft of the hinge
will act as a support
to prevent undue
sagging. An
arrangement must
be made to lock
this door. It can easily be secured
on the inside by a bolt, and outwardly
by hasp and padlock.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<a name="figp112a" id="figp112a"></a><img src="images/i_112a.jpg" width="200" height="344" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.</span></div>
</div>

<p>There remain, now, the peaks or
gables at the ends, to be provided
for. Many of the railway men get
their roof canvas sufficiently large
to come down and cover this, but
I think a better plan would be to
make two triangular platforms of
boards, fitted to your peak, cleating them together
just like the lower walls. Then place about four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
flat staples in the outside of your end walls, and let
iron hasps bolted to the lower edge of your peak
boards drop into them. This would hold the bottom
of the peak and the top of the end wall squarely
together. In addition to this a couple of bolts should
pass through the upright and be secured by nuts,
so as easily to be unscrewed. (<a href="#figp112"><i>See fig. 14.</i></a>)
There should be no middle cleat on the
inside of the gable. The general character
of these walls appears in several of the
illustrations, but the cleating is shown in
<a href="#figp112a"><i>fig. 1</i></a>. Screws should be used throughout
instead of nails. The woodwork remaining
to be shaped, consists of the uprights, or
centre-poles at each end, the ridgepole,
rafters and braces.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 100px;">
<a name="figp113" id="figp113"></a><img src="images/i_113.jpg" width="100" height="360" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 2.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The two uprights in my model were 8 feet and
9 inches in height; a greater length would add pitch
to the roof. These uprights should be made of clear,
firm stuff, 4 inches by 2, and should be thickened at
their lower ends by adding pieces of similar size, as
shown in <i>figures</i> <a href="#figp113">2</a> and <a href="#figp114a">4</a>. This upright stands inside of
the wall, and edge-wise. Into its upper inner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
edge must be set two iron “eyes” having an inner
diameter of three quarters of an inch. (<i>See fig. 3</i>). The
uppermost of these is placed about two inches from
the top of the stick, and
the second six inches below.
These eyes should pass clear
through the timber and be held by nuts on
the other side. Six feet from the bottom of
the upright, a hooked bolt should be passed
through the timber, the hook facing outwardly,
and having enough space between it and the
wood to allow the wall to come
between. Its purpose is to
hold the end wall snugly to
the upright: therefore it must
be loose enough so that it can
be turned up while the wall is
being put into position, and
then turned down to clamp
it firmly, as in <a href="#figp114a"><i>figure 4</i></a>.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<a name="figp114" id="figp114"></a><img src="images/i_114.jpg" width="200" height="238" alt="" />

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 4.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Having made both uprights
alike, you now turn your attention
to the ridgepole. This ought to be somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
heavier than the uprights, two by six scantling being
none too strong for the strain which the weight of
your canvas and an occasional gale of wind will put
upon it. It is twelve feet long, of course, and six
inches from each end will have an iron pin 18 inches
in length driven through from its upper side, intended
to go through the eyes at the top of the uprights.
This is shown in <a href="#figp115"><i>fig. 5</i></a>.</p>

<p>On each side of this ridgepole screw in four stout
staples or eyes, one at three inches from each
end, and the others at equal distances between; to
these the rafters are to be attached. (<i>See figs. <a href="#figp114">3</a> and <a href="#figp115">5</a>.</i>)
Similar staples must be placed an inch below the upper
inside edge of the side walls to contain the irons
at the lower end of the
rafters, as in <a href="#figp117"><i>fig. 6</i></a>; of
course, therefore, it is
necessary that the staples
in the walls should
fall exactly opposite those on the ridgepole.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">
<a name="figp115" id="figp115"></a><img src="images/i_115.jpg" width="250" height="115" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 5.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The rafters themselves, eight in number, may
be made of the same sized stuff as the uprights,
or lighter, if a tough wood like elm or ash is used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
instead of pine; and each will be 7 feet and 4
inches long unless you want a pretty steep roof,
in which case you must lengthen them somewhat.
To the underside of the upper end is fastened
a strong curved hook, which hangs in the staples on
the ridgepole (<a href="#figp115"><i>fig. 5</i></a>); while to the lower end is fastened
a pointed iron three inches long, and set at such
an angle that it will stand vertical in the eye on the
wall (<i>see <a href="#figp117">fig. 6</a> next paper</i>) when the rafter is in
place.</p>

<p class="drop-capt">THE braces are intended to serve the same purpose
as the guy-ropes of the ordinary wall tent, and
are three in number on each side. They consist of stout
sticks (two by four inches is a good size) long enough
to reach the ground from the top
of the wall (five and one half feet
in the present case) at an angle
of forty-five degrees. At the
upper end, underneath, which is
beveled to stand flat against the
face of the wall, the brace is
armed with a strong hook. This
hook sets into an eye inserted into the top of the
outside cleat, just as the rafters are hooked to
the ridgepole. At the lower end, which also is
beveled off to fit the ground, is fastened a large
ringbolt. This is on the upper side, so that when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
the brace is in position, the ring lies flat on the
ground beyond it, and through it is driven a barbed
pin of iron. These braces not only hold the wall
from sagging out, but equally prevent it from
pulling in, which
is just as great a
danger. How
they are arranged
is
seen at a
glance in
<a href="#figp118"><i>fig. 7</i></a>.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 450px;">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 7.</span></div>
</div>

<p>There is also another brace which goes across from
the corner of the side wall over the doorway to the
upright, where it is hooked into an eye placed six feet
above the ground. This cross-brace forms a lintel
to the door, and serves to make solid the otherwise
somewhat shaky end of the right-hand siding.</p>

<p>Now comes the setting up and roofing; but before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
you can do that you must provide fastenings at the
corners of your walls. I have reserved this for the
last, since it is the most difficult bit of mechanism.</p>

<p>Go to a blacksmith and have him forge for you
six pieces of iron of the shape shown in <a href="#figp119"><i>fig. 8</i></a>,
each about an inch and a half
wide, and an eighth of an inch
thick; the shafts, or straight
ends of three of them, should
measure six inches from the
point marked <i>a</i>, while the shafts of the others
should be nine inches in length, the elbow being
alike in both
cases. In the
shaft should be
punched two
holes big enough
to pass stout bolts
through; but in
both sizes these holes should be within six inches
from the straight end. Having provided yourself
with these bent irons, bolt one of the <em>short size</em> upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
each end of the <em>outside</em> of the <em>rear</em> wall of your house
six inches from the lower border, and in such a way
that the bent end
which is to be turned
<em>upward</em>, shall project
beyond the end of the wall just enough to leave a
space of a quarter of an inch between
the inside of the curve and the edge
of the cleat to which it is bolted. Draw
the nuts on your bolts very tight. Now take your
remaining short one, and put it upon the lower
corner of your
front wall, so that
its lower edge
shall be just seven
inches from
the bottom of the
wall, and with the
elbow projecting
as before, but
<em>turned down</em>.</p>

<p>You have now left your three longer pieces of iron.
One of these must be placed on the lower rear end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
of your right-hand side-wall (as you face the door)
at seven and one half inches above the bottom, and
with the elbow turned <em>down</em>. The other two go on
opposite ends of the left-hand wall, that at the
rear end turned <em>down</em>, and that in front turned
<em>up</em>, the former seven and
one half, the latter six
inches above the bottom
edge. But <em>all these long
ones must project</em> three
and one quarter <em>inches</em>,
because they must reach
past the edge of the adjoining wall, as you will see
when you stand the walls up; the edge of the rear
flush with face of the sidings, and lock them
together, as shown in <a href="#figp119a"><i>fig. 9</i></a>.</p>

<p>Though I have seen the same arrangement at the
top, yet a better way is as follows: (<i>Figs. <a href="#figp120">10</a>, <a href="#figp120a">11</a> and
<a href="#figp120b">12</a>.</i>)</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px;">
<a name="figp121" id="figp121"></a><img src="images/i_121.jpg" width="250" height="213" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 13.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Have your blacksmith make three flat pieces of
iron, each six and one half inches in length, having a
closed loop turned up at the end, which carries a link
six inches long, as in <a href="#figp120"><i>fig. 10</i></a>. Bolt this piece of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
iron near the upper corner of each of the end walls&mdash;that
is, above each of the <em>short</em> hooks, allowing the
loop in which the link hangs, <em>and no more</em>, to project.
Get at the same time three squarely bent hooks
of round iron (<a href="#figp120a"><i>fig. 11</i></a>), with a thread and nut at the long
end, and the bent-up point no longer than the inner
diameter of the link, lengthways, so that it will freely
pass through the
link. Set these
hooks in those unprovided
upper corners
of your remaining
walls that come
opposite your links
when the walls are
set up, at such a
distance that when
the link is bent around the corner it will snugly fit
over the hooks. In order to do this, however (and you
can see what I mean by a glance at <a href="#figp120b"><i>fig. 12</i></a>), you must
set your hooks so loosely that you can turn their points
backwards. The link is then slipped over, and the
reversion of the hook to the position shown in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
<a href="#figp120b"><i>fig. 12</i></a> binds the two walls cornering there as securely
together as the interlocking hooks hold them at the
bottom.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<a name="figp122" id="figp122"></a><img src="images/i_122.jpg" width="300" height="279" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 14.</span></div>
</div>

<p>You will notice that I have no clamps or link at
the front end near the door. There is no chance for
any. Instead we trust for solidity to the outside
brace, which is specially
important, and to the
horizontal brace which
extends across from the
top of the wall to the
forward upright. (<i>See
<a href="#figp121">fig. 13</a>.</i>)</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px;">
<a name="figp123" id="figp123"></a><img src="images/i_123.jpg" width="250" height="201" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 15.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The next thing is
your canvas. Measure how much you need for
your roof, and determine how far down your
walls you want it to extend. If you are going
to camp in very cold weather, you would do well
to have it all the way to the ground. It would
add greatly to the warmth. As a rule, though, you
will only want it to come well over the top of the
siding, with some lapping in front and rear to keep
out driving rains. When it is sewed into a big sheet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
you must attach to it at frequent intervals a short
stout strap. Opposite these straps (<a href="#figp123"><i>fig. 15</i></a>) nail to the
outside of your walls straps containing big buckles
(<a href="#figp122"><i>fig. 14</i></a>) whereby you can buckle down taut your
canvas roof. I know of no more secure and convenient
method of holding
the tent cover than this;
but I would advise
you to experiment
on the
reach and “full” of your cloth before nailing the
buckles to the wood work.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<a name="figp124" id="figp124"></a><img src="images/i_124.jpg" width="450" height="323" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 16.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Now comes the setting of your tent-house up.
The first consideration is the position. I can only
say that it should be level, and where water will not
drain into it in case of heavy rains. The next thing
to be decided is, Will you have a floor? If so,
lay it a few inches larger than your building, set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
your house on it, and nail down a narrow cleat all
around inside close to the wall; an upright bolt
dropping into the floor in the centre of each side,
will be well also.</p>

<p>First set up the centre poles and ridgepole, placing
the latter on top of the former, and sliding the
iron pins down through the eyes. (<i><a href="#figp114">Fig. 3</a>.</i>) Then
place in position the <em>rear</em> wall. The side walls will
come next, their clamps dropping easily at the corners
into those of the end wall, and holding them firm
while you slip the links over their hooks and twist
them tight. Then set up the braces at the door end,
and put up the front wall, turning down the tent pin
on the ridgepole, to hold it firm, and locking the
whole structure with the last link. Next, hook on
the rafters, bolt the triangular gable walls to the upper
part of the ridgepole, and set your braces at the sides.
Nothing remains but to draw over your canvas, put
your door upon its hinges, and hang up your hat.
You are at home; a home you have put together at
leisure hours in your barn or woodshed during the
winter, have taken to the woods in a lumber-wagon,
and set up with the help of a single companion;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
and when you are done with it you will carry it back
to town and store it away in the woodshed or stable
again.</p>

<p>In respect to the cost, I can give no estimates so
good as in a few moments you can compile for yourself.
It all depends on the price of materials and
the cost of blacksmithing in your own neighborhood.
The weight and breadth of the canvas purchased is
also to be estimated variously, according to your
selection, and the expense will be increased according
to the degree of finishing, painting, and decoration
put upon the structure. If I should make one for
myself in New York or New Jersey, I should not anticipate
its costing me more than twenty-five dollars
ready for setting up; but this includes no floor and
no painting. The interior furnishing of cots, cupboards,
tables, stoves, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">et cetera</i>, I presume you will understand
as well as I. Also that you can contrive to
put in windows as you want them, and provide a
means of carrying your stovepipe through a tin ring
in the canvas roof so as to be safe from ignition. I
only wish I might help enjoy all the fun you will have!</p>

<h2><a name="XVI_HOW_TO_MAKE_A_FERNERY" id="XVI_HOW_TO_MAKE_A_FERNERY"></a>XVI.&mdash;HOW TO MAKE A FERNERY.</h2>


<p class="drop-capt">AUTUMN is the time to be getting ready for your
fernery&mdash;all you who are off in the country
(or who live there), or are just getting back from
your summer vacation, with a big parcel of ferns and
things which you collected at the White Mountains,
or among the Green Mountains, or the Berkshire
Hills, or at Mount Desert, or in some woods, or by
some pond, or by the sea, or somewhere, no matter
where&mdash;lovely things were around you wherever you
went.</p>

<p>I know what you have been doing: for, have
I not seen in my summer trips for these twenty years,
how you young people do; how it seems as if you
wanted to carry all the woods home with you; how,
hot and tired, but happy, you have been seen coming
back to the farmhouse or hotel where you boarded,
with your arms full; how you put your treasures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
safely away in the coolest, shadiest corner of the back
piazza, and asked anxiously if they would keep till
you could get them home? And when the morning of
packing up came, what a stir to get them all into the
smallest possible compass; for were not the older folks
of the party all complaining because the boys had
cut so many cones, and the æsthetic grown-up daughters
had such bundles of cat-tails and sun-flowers, so
that the “baggage” was already beyond all bounds
of reason!</p>

<p>If it should happen that you have not secured what
you would like to stock your fernery with, you can do
it now: and if anybody should tell you that those
frail-looking things will not stand the journey home,
you can answer, on my authority, that they are mistaken.
Just get the roots, and you are all right. I
have not much doubt that there are ferns growing in
a Western city to-day from some dry-looking roots
which a lady from New England took out with her,
and after being a week on her journey, distributed
among her friends, so that the ferneries all about the
city were beautiful with them by Christmas time.</p>

<p>There is a good deal of vitality in roots: their hold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
on life is something wonderful. Plant them, and you
will hear from them, as Doctor Franklin did from a seed
or two he found in a piece of broom corn, to which, I
suppose, all the brooms in the United States may be
traced.</p>

<p>Therefore, collect, and have patience. The way is
to tear up a whole mass of the greenery from some
moist knoll or hummock, moss and all. It will be
sure to be full of things, gold-thread, bunch-berry,
partridge-berry, mitre-wort and dew-berry; and every
one of them will blossom in a fernery in winter. No
knowing what will come up out of the moss. Get
also from the woods the two-leaved Solomon’s seal&mdash;you
will know it by the bunch of finely speckled
berries; the Indian cucumber root, the rattle-snake
plantain, lady’s slipper, wake robin, chick-weed, winter-green,
princes’ pine, pyrola. All these and many
others will bloom there, and violets. I might make
a long list of flowers, besides nearly all kinds of
ferns, and mosses. But it is well to get any and
every little delicate woods’ plant that you like; roll
them up in moss, which will keep them damp enough,
and when you get home, fit up your fernery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>But first&mdash;in accordance with the principle laid
down by the famous Mrs. Glass, in her cook-book, who
says about cooking a hare, “first, get your hare,”&mdash;you
will first <em>get</em> your fernery.</p>

<p>Many persons would have one quickly enough but
for thinking the expense too great. But it is not at
all important that you have one of those nice black
walnut cases with the costly oval or round glass.
A home-made one is more convenient, and much
cheaper.</p>

<p>This, which the artist has drawn from one in use,
is, as you notice, proportioned like a house with a
steep roof. The frame is of hard wood&mdash;a mere
sash to hold the glass (for it is really a glass house),
so are the bottom or floor, and the base, which is
about four inches deep. A groove is cut in the sash,
in which the glass is set firmly; no putty was used,
though I should suggest it as being more secure. All
the corners are dovetailed together and made sure
by little brads.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<a name="figp131" id="figp131"></a><img src="images/i_131.jpg" width="450" height="344" alt="" />
<div class="caption">A FERNERY.</div>
</div>

<p>The roof is separate, so as to be lifted off; and
when on, is kept fast in place by means of two little
corks the size of a pipe stem, which are fastened to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
the pieces of wood at the bottom of the roof, and shut
into holes made for them in the strips on which it is
set, so that when closed not so much as a crack is to
be seen. This is eighteen inches long and fourteen
wide, and from base to top is twenty-four inches.
The glass sides are about ten by sixteen; the ends
ten by twelve; the sides of the roof are ten by sixteen,
and the triangular pieces at the ends, ten by ten.
One could be more elegantly proportioned if the roof
was not so steep. These figures are given as a guide.
This is very roomy, especially in height; but that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
is no disadvantage, because a tall fern can be set
in the middle and have space to spread off at will, or
some little hooks can be screwed into the ridgepole
(likening it to a house), and tiny hanging things suspended
from them.</p>

<p>The glass is of the common window-pane kind,
and was about eleven cents a pane; eight panes were
required, and the man who had them for sale cut
them to fit the sash. The wood was maple, and was
hunted out of the odds and ends in the loft of the
wood-house. Any thoroughly seasoned wood, even
pine, is suitable, and the cost is not worth mentioning.
The frame should be neatly finished and joined,
should be strong and firm on account of the weight
after the earth and plants are in; and before the
glass is cut, should be stained, or oiled, or painted,
outside and in. A pretty stain is made by stirring a
tablespoonful of burnt umber into a cup of vinegar,
more or less, according to whether you wish the
color to be lighter or darker. Stir vigorously and
put it on with a little swab: it will dry in the course
of a few hours, and then can be varnished if you like.
Five cents’ worth of umber is enough to do your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
fernery, with plenty left for three or four brackets
besides.</p>

<p>All the work should be faithfully done, for you
want no shrinking or gaping or warping afterwards.
You must remember that it is to be subjected to
dampness within and dryness without. Once done
well, your fernery will last for years, and you can
have something beautiful in it from January till January
comes again, a perpetual delight to all who see
it; and costing so little.</p>

<p>Now, an important part remains&mdash;the movable
zinc tray, which must just fill the wooden bottom,
and be of the same height, but not fit so closely that
you cannot take it out when necessary. Ours cost
fifty cents, but may be made for less; any tin-man
will make it.</p>

<p>There you have the figures. You can proportion
one as you like, but this is large enough unless you
wish to set little flower pots in; but a larger one
would be heavy to move about, and instead of a fernery
one would need a Wardian case.</p>

<p>Now, for the fitting up. Last October we removed
the roof and the tray and washed the glass, preparatory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
to having everything fresh and clean for the
coming winter. The old contents were emptied, and
we began anew. The first thing was to place a layer
of broken brick, and small pebbles and gravel, on the
bottom of the tray for drainage, perhaps an inch and
a half deep, over which we scattered bits of charcoal
to keep all pure. We had previously collected a great
store of things from the woods with which to stock it,
taking up a whole mat of moss with all that therein
grew, and everything with a little of the woods’ mould
on the roots; also we had a clump of pitcher plants
from a cranberry meadow, and some rattle-snake
plantain. Altogether for our fourteen by eighteen
accommodations, I should judge that we had about a
wheel-barrow load of material to select from; but we
were in the country then.</p>

<p>It is always desirable to use the rich, mellow leaf
mould that is found in the woods. You can easily
take up your plants with enough of it clinging about
them; and it is so loose and light it will not add
materially to the bulk or weight. Not much is needed
for the fernery; two or three inches of it only above
the bed of drainage, mixed with a little sand. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
cities it can be obtained from greenhouses. Many
of the plants would flourish if only moss was put in.</p>

<p>In ours we placed a good layer of such soil; and the
first plant we set out was a tall, beautiful fern which
reached nearly to the roof, for we wanted it to look
pretty all at once without waiting for things to grow.
Then a pitcher-plant, purple polygala, creeping snow-berry,
lots of partridge-berry, with the scarlet berries
on, and nearly all of the wild things I have named.
Then we went into the garden and dug up lilies-of-the-valley
that we were sure were going to bloom,
which is indicated by the bluntness and plumpness
of the crown just above ground (the leaves were
gone), also roots of pansy and fragrant single violet.
These we put into the corners where they would have
the most light. We packed the tray full, too full,
perhaps, not forgetting roots of maiden-hair fern.
We had not much faith in trailing arbutus, though we
set out a root or two; our hopes for that sweet flower
we based on the clusters of buds we gathered from
the woods, and these we put in a small tumbler of
water and set among the greenery.</p>

<p>Then we gave our little garden under glass a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
thorough sprinkling, put the roof on, and set it in
the light. Occasionally we raised it and admitted
the air for a short time, but it does not answer to do
this often. It must be kept covered, watered perhaps
once a month, kept in the light and warmth.</p>

<p>The result to us was beyond our highest anticipations.
Though the pansies did nothing but grow tall
and rank, there was always a violet to give a friend&mdash;a
delectable violet which made the room fragrant when
it was taken out; there were “many flowers” week
after week; mitre-wort bloomed, princes’ pine, gold-thread,
and other little things; and while snow yet
lay on the ground, the lilies-of-the-valley blossomed.
Greatest success of all, and to our utter amazement,
the pitcher-plant flowered, maiden-hair thrived, the
great fern spread off till its tips touched the glass, the
rattle-snake plantain sent up a spire of bloom, and
everything was beautiful.</p>

<p>I have told you now the method, the expense,
and how simple a thing it is to fit up a fernery.
Another winter we shall put in tulip bulbs and
some other garden plants there may be room for.
Things will bear packing quite closely if you are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
careful to keep those that like the shade in the background,
and let the others have the best chance
for the light. Occasionally the fernery needs turning
so the sun can reach all; otherwise it requires
but little care.</p>

<h2><a name="XVII_A_BOYS_RAILWAY_AND_TRAIN" id="XVII_A_BOYS_RAILWAY_AND_TRAIN"></a>XVII.&mdash;A BOY’S RAILWAY AND TRAIN.</h2>


<p class="drop-capt">IN a certain old-fashioned house that I visit, a
large attic is set apart as a playroom for the
boys, in which to keep their tools, their jig-saw, and
their treasures of all sorts, dear to the hearts of young
people.</p>

<p>All around the edge of this room runs a small
railway with curves and switches complete, with
bridges and tunnels, and an elegant station, made of
a deserted dog house, and painted in the newest
style.</p>

<p>Over this track, propelled by boy-power, runs
many times a day, a train of cigar-box cars, engine
and tender, baggage and passenger cars, all in order.
And everything about it, from the ties to the latest
parlor car, was made by two boys under fourteen
years of age, at a very small cost.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 100px;">
<a name="figp139" id="figp139"></a><img src="images/i_139.jpg" width="100" height="85" alt="" />
<div class="caption">FIG. 1.</div>
</div>

<p>These boys are no wiser or more skilful than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
other boys, and there is nothing about it hard to
make. I thought many of you young readers of
mine would like to copy it, and so I have
studied the thing, taken my instructions from the
builder himself, and here it is, so plainly told that
no ordinary boy of twelve need make a
mistake if he follows directions exactly,
although to make it perfectly clear, I
have to use a good many words which
make it <em>look</em> hard. To begin with the track: first,
come</p>


<p class="ph3">THE TIES.</p>

<p>To make ties for a single track, take a board one
inch thick. Saw from the end a piece five inches
long, and split it with a chisel into ties an inch square.
The number you will need depends, of course, upon
the length of your road. Having these ready, the
next thing is the</p>


<p class="ph3">RAILS.</p>

<p>Buy at a tinner’s sheets of tin which come fourteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
by twenty inches in size, though any other size may
be used. If convenient, have the tinner cut each
sheet into eleven strips twenty feet long and about
one and a quarter wide. You can, however, cut them
yourself, with a pair of old shears, first measuring
carefully, and ruling the sheet off.</p>

<p>Along one side of each strip of tin, near the edge,
punch nail holes; one close to each end, and four
between, making thus six holes about four inches
apart.</p>

<p>To bend the rail to shape, take a ruler and scratch
a line the whole length one quarter of an inch from
the edge which has no holes. Lay this edge on a
straight board, with the mark exactly on the edge of
the board, so that the quarter of an inch sticks out
beyond the board. Then tack the tin with two or
three tacks, to keep it from slipping, while you take a
hammer and pound the tin down over the edge till it
is bent at a right angle to the rest. Then take out
your tacks, and laying the tin on the board, pound
this turned-up edge over till nearly flat. This makes
the top of your rail, as you see in <i><a href="#figp139">fig. 1</a></i> (which shows
the end of a rail) at <i>a</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>To make the bend <i>c</i> (<i><a href="#figp139">fig. 1</a></i>) draw a line the whole
length half an inch from the edge where the holes
are. Again tack the tin to the board, with the half-inch
sticking out beyond, and pound this edge over
into a right angle. This completes your rail, the holes
being along the edge marked <i>b</i> in the figure.</p>


<p class="ph3">TO LAY THE TRACK.</p>

<p>Place a number of ties side by side, and with a
ruler and pencil draw two lines across them, three
and a half inches apart, having about three quarters
of an inch beyond the lines at each end. These
marks are to guide you in laying the track straight.
When you have thus prepared a number of ties and
rails, fasten them together by nailing, with small-sized
carpet tacks, through each punched hole, on to a tie,
being careful that the <em>end</em> of each rail reaches no
more than half over its tie, so that the next rail may
join on right (<i><a href="#figp143">fig. 2</a></i>). The tacked edges of the two
rails turn towards each other on the inside of the
track, and thus do not show when a train is on, and
the angle <i>c</i> rests exactly on the line drawn on the tie.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
Go on in this way till your rails are all used, or you
come to a curve.</p>


<p class="ph3">TO MAKE A CURVE.</p>

<p>Take a cold chisel, or an old common chisel, and
one of your finished rails. On the flat side (from
<i>b</i> to <i>c</i>, in <i><a href="#figp139">fig. 1</a></i>) cut slits reaching from <i>b</i> to <i>c</i>, and half
an inch apart. Lay a row of ties in the curve you
wish to make, and bend the rail to fit them. The slits
will enable you to bend them nicely, on one side
by gaping apart, and on the other by slipping over.</p>

<p>If you want a guard rail to keep your train from
running off at this point, lay an extra rail fastened in
the same way inside of each rail on the curve.</p>


<p class="ph3">TO MAKE A SWITCH.</p>

<p>Select a point where two rails join, for a switch,
and take one length of rail for the purpose. This
length, which includes both rails, of course, is to be
movable, and so must slide over the common ties,
and not be fastened to them. To keep them in place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
they must be tacked to special ties, much thinner,
and coming between the regular ties that they slide
over. Having prepared this length, put a tack,
smaller than the hole you have punched, through
the end hole at <i>a</i> (<i><a href="#figp148">fig. 4</a></i>), so that the switch will
move easily on it.</p>

<p>At <i>b.</i> (<i><a href="#figp144">fig. 3</a>.</i>), where your two tracks come together,
you must put pegs (<i>b. b.</i>) to keep the switch
from moving too far either way,
and throwing your train off.
Also, from this point, the ties
must be long enough to hold
the side track till it is clear of
the regular track (<i><a href="#figp144">fig. 3</a></i>). The curve of this side
track is made, of course, by the directions for making
a curve. The last special tie at <i>c</i> (<i>fig. 3</i>)
must run out far enough to take a hold of, to
move the switch.</p>


<p class="ph3">TO MAKE A FROG.</p>

<p>At the point where the rails cross (<i>d</i>, <i><a href="#figp144">fig. 3</a>.</i>) you
will need a frog, to allow your train to go smoothly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
over. To make this, you
cut your side rails square
off at <i>d</i>, and begin it
again on the inside of the
rail, leaving a space of a
quarter of an inch open
to let the flange of your
car wheels pass through.</p>

<p>Also, you must cut a
notch in your regular
track at the same point,
so that the wheels on
trains switching off may
go through (<i><a href="#figp148">fig. 4</a></i>).</p>

<p>Now your track is
ready, you may begin on
the train; and first the
trucks.</p>

</div>


<p class="ph3">TO MAKE THE TRUCKS.</p>

<p>For wheels you need a lot of rather large spools
with quite thick shanks, unless you can afford to
have brass or wooden ones turned for you. The best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
spools come in the shops of New York, with French
sewing cotton, and next best are those which hold
the knitting silk, so much used nowadays by
ladies.</p>

<p>Ask your mother and sisters, and all your fancy-work
loving friends, to save their spools for
you, and it will not be long before you have
enough.</p>

<p>Saw each spool into three pieces, as at <i>a, a</i> (<i><a href="#figp149">fig. 5</a></i>).
The outsides form the wheels with their flanges
<i>c, c,</i> and the middle piece <i>b</i>, you will need later.</p>

<p>Now for axles, the best are cheap lead pencils (cost
one cent each), but you can use common skewers
such as butchers use, whittled down to fit. The
axles are to fit tightly into the wheels, and turn
with them.</p>

<p>Now take a block an inch thick, four inches long,
and two and a half wide, to hold the wheels. In
each corner of the underside of the block, three
quarters of an inch from the end, screw a very
light wire screw ring (or screw eye) with a ring a
half-inch in diameter.</p>

<p>The axles run through these rings with the flanges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
of the wheels next to the block, to run inside the
track.</p>

<p>Next comes the car itself.</p>


<p class="ph3">TO MAKE THE CARS.</p>

<p>Cigar boxes are nice for cars, being already very
neatly made. You can get at the cigar stores, at
small cost, if not as a gift, any number of boxes
with square ends, that is, with the ends of the box
as high as they are wide. After you have washed
off the paper, get two boards, one a quarter or three
eighths of an inch thick, and the other somewhat
thinner, both being the width of the box. Saw off
pieces three inches longer than the boxes, for platform
and roof.</p>

<p>First fasten your trucks under the thicker board,
which is the bottom. To do this, bore a gimlet hole
exactly through the middle of each truck block;
put a six-penny nail from the bottom, first through
the hole in the truck block, then through the cast-off
part of a spool (<i>b</i>, <i><a href="#figp149">fig. 5</a></i>), or half of it if too thick,
or a small twist spool a half-inch high. Nail one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
to each end of the board loosely, so it will turn.</p>

<p>Now, carefully take apart your cigar box, and
mark on each long side a row of windows, like a
passenger car, and in each end piece mark a door.
Saw them out on a jig saw. (If you have no saw you
can paint windows on the outside.)</p>

<p>After cutting the windows and doors, put the box
together again, with the brads which held it before,
and laying it on to the platform board, so that each
end of the board projects for a platform, nail them
together. Then open the cover (which must never
be broken off) and nail the roof board on to it in the
same way; that is, so it will project at each end. Use
brads for this nailing. The object of fastening the
roof to the cover is that you may open your car
and fill it with passengers if you choose.</p>


<p class="ph3">TO MAKE THE COUPLINGS.</p>


<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">
<a name="figp148" id="figp148"></a><img src="images/i_148.jpg" width="250" height="201" alt="" />
<div class="caption">FIG. 4.</div>
</div>

<p>Take pieces of stiff copper wire three inches long,
and with pliers bend over one end of each to form
a hook, and the other ends into a small ring. Turning
your car upside down, lay one of these wires<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
in the middle of the end, with only the hook sticking
out, and fasten it by a small screw through the ring
(<i><a href="#figp149a">fig. 6</a></i>); do the same at the other end, and then
with some small brass curtain rings, which cost
two or three cents a dozen,
you can couple your cars
nicely.</p>

<p>Baggage and freight cars
you can make in the same
way, only cutting one large
door in the side. You can
make the cars as showy as you please, with paint
of different colors, and finish them with a piece of
muslin glued part way over the windows inside for
shades. And now last comes the engine.</p>


<p class="ph3">TO MAKE THE ENGINE.</p>

<p>For the foundation take a board one foot long,
and three inches wide, which I will call the platform.
To make the boiler, have a cylinder turned
of wood, two and a half inches in diameter, and
eight inches long; or take a square piece of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
size and shave it down yourself to a cylinder; or&mdash;what
is less trouble, and costs little&mdash;have a tinner
make one for you, open at both ends, of course.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;">
<a name="figp149" id="figp149"></a><img src="images/i_149.jpg" width="150" height="187" alt="" />
<div class="caption">FIG. 5.</div>
</div>

<p>The one I will describe, since it
is the most simple to make, is the
wooden one. Nail it to the platform
board in such a way that the
board will project in front one
inch. You will have to nail it
from the bottom of the board.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 100px;">
<a name="figp149a" id="figp149a"></a><img src="images/i_149a.jpg" width="100" height="203" alt="" />
<div class="caption">FIG. 6.</div>
</div>

<p>Now take a three-quarter-inch auger and bore
a hole one inch deep, in the top of the boiler,
one half inch from the front end. This is
to receive the smoke stack. To make the
smoke stack, get a piece of dowelling
three quarters of an inch thick, and four
inches long, or use a bit of broom handle
of that length. Shave the end down till
it fits nicely into the hole on top of the
boiler. Have it reach to the bottom of
the hole, so as to be firm, and leave three inches
standing up.</p>

<p>To finish the smoke stack, and make it look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
like the newest fashion in American engines, you
must nail on to the top, with brads, a round piece of
wood, a quarter of an inch thick, and a quarter of
an inch larger all around than the broomstick itself.
Behind the boiler</p>


<p class="ph3">MAKE THE CAB.</p>

<p>This is a peculiar thing, and the boy builder of the
cigar-box train insists that it must be done exactly as
he directs, in order to make a really <em>proper</em> cab. To
proceed, then:</p>

<p>For the front piece take a board a half-inch thick,
three and three quarters inches high, and two and
a half wide. Cut with a jig saw, near the top, two
windows, one on each side, to overlook the engine.
Nail this to the back end of the boiler, and to the
floor. Make the two side pieces of the cab of cigar-box
wood three inches wide and four inches high.
In these cut two windows, also near the top. Before
you nail these side pieces on, make a third piece
out of half-inch wood, two and a quarter inches
long, by two and a half wide, and nail it with brads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
to the front piece of the cab, one inch from the floor,
like a shelf. This is the real floor, and without it
your cab will be a mere toy, and not at all the correct
thing. Having this shelf in place, nail on your side
pieces, both to the front piece, and to the shelf.</p>

<p>The roof requires a piece of thin board, two and
a half inches wide, and four inches long, so that it
will project one inch beyond the sides. Remember
it must be put <em>between</em> the side pieces, and on
<em>top</em> of the front piece, and nailed with brads.</p>


<p class="ph3">TO MAKE THE DRIVING WHEELS.</p>

<p>The engine wheels are four in number, made by
sawing from half-inch board four circles four inches
in diameter, and from cigar-box wood an equal
number four and a half inches in diameter. Each
wheel is double, you see, to form the flange which
keeps it on the track. Nail with little brads, each
larger circle on to a smaller one, so that the former
will project equally all around. Then bore a hole
exactly in the middle of each, and your wheels are
ready. With lath nails fasten one pair of wheels to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
the platform board at the side of the cab (flanges
inside, of course), and the other pair to the same
board in front, and so far that the rims of the two
wheels on one side will be about two inches apart.</p>


<p class="ph3">TO MAKE THE COW-CATCHER.</p>

<p>For this very important addition to the engine
take a piece of wood three inches wide and two
inches thick. Saw it on <em>both</em> sides to a point (<i><a href="#figp153">fig. 7</a></i>).
First shave it down on top so that it forms a sharp
point at <i>b</i>, <i><a href="#figp153">fig. 7</a></i>. Then draw a line through the
middle of the top (<i>a</i> to <i>b</i>, <i><a href="#figp153">fig. 7</a></i>), and shave down
each side so that it shall present a sharp edge all
around from <i>c</i> to <i>b</i>, and from <i>b</i> to <i>d</i> (<i><a href="#figp153">fig. 7</a></i>). Nail
this to the front end of the platform board with
inch-long brads.</p>


<p class="ph3">TO MAKE THE TENDER.</p>

<p>This is very easily made of a cigar box, one of
the low sort, the same width as your cars, but only
half the height. Remove the cover and take out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
one end board. Put the box on a board a half-inch
longer than itself, and finish with trucks as you did
your cars.</p>

<p>At the back end of this tender&mdash;the closed end&mdash;fasten
couplings like these on the cars, but to the
engine it may be fastened by a common wire hook
and eye. The hook being on the engine.</p>

<p>This completes your train, and if you wish to make
a double track, you need only make your ties long
enough to allow trains to pass, and then lay your
tracks side by side.</p>

<p>With a little ingenuity, you can make bridges and
tunnels, freight trains, and gravel trains, and can,
in fact, increase your “rolling
stock” to any extent.</p>

<p>I hope you will enjoy building
this railway and train half as much
as did the boys in the attic in
New York City. With them the building and improving,
the running of trains and the adding of
new facilities, make a never-ending entertainment.</p>

<h2><a name="XVIII_HOW_TO_MAKE_A_GOOD_FLY" id="XVIII_HOW_TO_MAKE_A_GOOD_FLY"></a>XVIII.&mdash;HOW TO MAKE A GOOD FLY.</h2>


<p class="drop-capt">FLY-FISHING is poetry; ordinary angling is
prose. The latter looks to the catch; the former
to skill shown in the capture. There is more sport
in hooking and playing one single bass with a light
pliant fly-rod, than in dragging in a dozen by mere
muscular force. To cast a fly lightly to a chosen
spot, to note instantly the swell indicative of a
“rise,” to strike at once, but deliberately, to keep
your rod bent, your line taut, and your fish in the
water long enough to exhaust him, all require judgment,
skill and self-control.</p>

<p>But after you have put up your rod for the season,
you may still extract pleasure from mending your
tackle, putting reel and rod in order, and last, but
not least, in making a supply of artificial flies for
future fishing.</p>

<div class="caption">FIG. 1.</div>
</div>

<p>The articles necessary for making flies are hooks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
silk, white wax, silkworm-gut, tinsel-feather fibres&mdash;dubbing
for the bodies of fur, wool, silk or feathers&mdash;hackles
for legs, and larger feathers for wings.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 150px;">

<div class="caption">FIG. 3.</div>
</div>

<p>First, get a good hook. The good hook is as
sharp as a needle, and the barbed end points
nearly exactly in a line with the end of the shank;
not inside of the “line of pull,” <i>a</i>, <i>b</i> (see <a href="#figp155">fig. 1</a>), lest
the point come not in contact with the fish; nor too
far out,
lest the
barb be
pulled
flatwise
against the fish’s mouth, and thus not pierce it readily;
nor exactly <em>in</em> the line of pull, for,
though in that case it would pierce
anything between the point and end
of shank, it might slip out without
touching the unclosed jaws
before the jaw had passed the
line of pull. A point like <i>x</i> would
be bad, so would one like <i>z</i>; but
one like <i>y</i> would be about right.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
Now take the hook between the forefinger and thumb
of your left hand, the shank pointing to your right,
as in <a href="#figp155a">fig. 2</a>. Say the end of a strong piece of silk,
well waxed, on the hook near the bend, and, holding
it firmly with your forefinger and thumb, wrap it
tightly around the hook nearly to the end of the
shank, as in <a href="#figp156">fig. 3</a>. Now coil a piece of silkworm-tug
that has been soaked ten or fifteen minutes, and
lay it on the hook with the coil to your right, and
wrap it with your silk carefully and firmly down to
the bend of the hook, cutting off the silkworm-gut a
little before you get to the bend,
so as to cover it well with the wrap,
like <a href="#figp157">fig. 4</a>, at first; it looks like <a href="#figp157a">fig.
5</a> after wrapping. Now take two
of the fibres of a peacock’s feather,
technically known as peacock’s herl, and a piece of
silver or gilt tinsel; lay the tinsel on near the bend, and
then, after two wraps of the silk, lay on the two
pieces of peacock’s herl, which must be fastened by
two or three wraps, as in <a href="#figp158">fig. 6</a>. Now fasten in with
a turn or two of the silk the dubbing for the body of
the fly. Supposing it to be peacock’s herl, three or four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
pieces will do, as in <a href="#figp158a">fig. 7</a>. Then take a hackle-feather,
shaped like <a href="#figp158b">fig. 8</a>, from the
neck or rump of a gamecock
or brown leghorn, and fasten
in the point with three wraps
of your silk, as in <a href="#figp159">fig. 9</a>.</p>

</div>

<p>You have now a hook, <i>a</i>,
wrapped with well-waxed silk, <i>b</i>, with a piece of
silkworm-gut, <i>c</i>, a piece of tinsel, <i>d</i>, two tail-pieces,
<i>e, e</i>, dubbing for body, <i>f, f, f</i> and hackle for legs, <i>g</i>.</p>

<div class="caption">FIG. 8.</div>
</div>

<p>Now for the wings. Strip off or cut from a
hawk’s feather, like <a href="#figp159a">fig. 10</a>, a clipping or two, like
<a href="#figp160">fig. 11</a>, and fold it into a convenient width, and
clip the ends square, like <a href="#figp160a">fig. 12</a>. Lay them on
the shank of the hook, butts
to the left, points to the right,
and fasten with three or four
firm wraps, as in <a href="#figp160b">fig. 13</a>. Now
draw the silk under the wing,
between them and the hook,
to hold them temporarily, and going back to the
bend of the hook, wind the dubbing, <i>f, f, f</i> around
the hook over and to your right as far as the root of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
the wings, leaving the hackle out; fasten
the dubbing with
one or two wraps,
taking the silk from
under the wing to
do the wrapping.
Next wind your tinsel
<i>d</i> up to the same
point and fasten in
same way. Now wind your hackle towards the right,
twisting the quill as
you wind to keep
the fibres sticking
outwards, and picking
out any fibres
that get entangled
with a dubbing-needle
(a needle stuck in a piece of soft pine, like
<a href="#figp160c">fig. 14</a>) and fasten. Now turn back the wings
with the points to your left, towards the bend of
the hook; fasten back
with one or two wraps,
passing the silk through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
an opening between the wings made by the dubbing-needle,
to separate them. Finish by making two
loose wraps, like <a href="#figp160d">fig. 15</a>; then draw the silk through
them tightly, like <a href="#figp161">fig. 16</a>. Touch this fastening
with a drop of
gum-shellac, and
it will not slip or
be affected by
water. Gum-shellac
dissolved in
alcohol can be gotten
at any drugstore,
and should
be rather thick. Your fly will now look like <a href="#figp161a">fig.
17</a>.</p>

<p>Your flies should be <em>rough</em> imitations of any water-flies
you see in your tramps, in <em>color</em> and <em>number</em> of
<em>parts</em>; outrageously colored flies will be taken by
black bass, who seem to bite at anything that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
has the nearest apologies for body, wings and
legs. All game-fish
bite readily at a simple
hackle wound
from bend to shank around any attractively colored
body in the form of a caterpillar; a good one for
black bass is made with one reddish-brown
hackle and two black ones; and a body of
peacock’s herl
wrapped with
green or red silk
is a good imitation
of a caterpillar
common here
(in Virginia) in
November.</p>

<p>Anglers also
make something having no counterpart in nature&mdash;a
winged hackle&mdash;by tying
the hackle in a winged fly back from the bend to the end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
of shank&mdash;a sort of winged caterpillar. Some fish, no
doubt, are affected by it as by a caterpillar; others
as by a fly; others just strike out of curiosity, as a
kitten plays with a ball. Should
you buy your tackle, buy from
tackle-makers who angle occasionally
themselves. They
know more “wrinkles” in their “line” in a day than ordinary
makers learn in a year. Some of the best houses
in Boston, New York and Baltimore derive their
most valuable specialties from the presence of one
or more actual anglers in the firms.</p>

<p class="pclear">Water-flies have generally, like the Mayfly,
<a href="#figp162">fig. 18</a>, a body,
wings, legs, and tail-like
appendages, technically,
so you will not
be far wrong if you
make your fly have
those parts, though
fish bite at flies with
less than these enumerated. For black bass, greens,
yellows and reds seem the best colors, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
white and black are often used. I like, however,
flies that are combinations
of bright and
sober tints. A favorite
fly with me has a body
of peacock’s herl brown;
wings, yellowish-white
feather of chicken-hawk with discolorations on
them; legs, a reddish-brown hackle from a gamecock
or brown leghorn cock; tail-pieces, two fibres,
like wings. I put a red streak in each wing. I
call it the “academy,” after a school once under my
care.</p>

<h2><a name="XIX_HOW_TO_BIND_MAGAZINES" id="XIX_HOW_TO_BIND_MAGAZINES"></a>XIX.&mdash;HOW TO BIND MAGAZINES.</h2>


<p class="drop-capt">IT is often the case that in households where
even several magazines are taken, that little
money can be afforded for the purpose of binding
them; and it follows that they are soon destroyed, or
else stored away and never looked at. The pretty
covers provided for most magazines by the publishers
are of course preferable; but they also, of course,
cost something. Therefore I have concluded to tell
you of a durable, cheaper, and on the whole, pretty
way of binding your yearly, or half-yearly volumes.</p>

<p>For several years we have made it a business to
bind up our magazines every spring before cleaning
house time; and we proudly exhibit to our friends
our collections of neat, strong books which would look
well in any library. We usually turn a corner of the
living-room into a bindery, as we have no workshop.</p>

<p>We bring in the work-bench with vise attached,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
pile our magazines on it, sort them into volumes,
remove the covers and advertising leaves, put the
engravings in their
proper places if
they are not there,
place each volume
according to date
or page, lay the
title page and table
of contents at the top of each pile, and there are our
magazines ready to bind. We have meantime a little
pot of good glue in readiness on the stove, which,
after it is dissolved thoroughly, is better to be kept
only warm. A little good twine, a few strips of
strong cloth, about an inch wide, a handsaw, a pair of
shears, and some of the old covers and leaves are
also at hand on the bench. Also we have two bars
of wood an inch thick, two or three inches wide, and
about two feet long, fastened together at one or both
ends (one end only is necessary if a vise is used) by
a bolt five or six inches long&mdash;this is the press.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<a name="figp164" id="figp164"></a><img src="images/i_164.jpg" width="300" height="182" alt="" />
<div class="caption">FIG. 1.</div>
</div>

<p>Now we take a volume of the magazines, lay an old
cover on each side. Making sure that the numbers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
are perfectly even at the back and upper ends, we
place them in the press with the backs projecting a
quarter of an inch at least, placing them in the vise
with the backs in a horizontal position (<i>see <a href="#figp164">fig. 1</a></i>)
and screw up pretty tightly. Then we saw into
the backs as far as they project in three places
(<i><a href="#figp164">fig. 1</a></i>). Next we dip
a piece of cord into
the glue, and wind it
back and forth once
or twice in the grooves
made by the saw. This, as you will see, binds the
volume firmly together.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">
<a name="figp165" id="figp165"></a><img src="images/i_165.jpg" width="250" height="106" alt="" />
<div class="caption">FIG. 2.</div>
</div>

<p>Now we take as many strips of cloth as there are
grooves, each about six inches long, and gluing them
in the middle, place one in each groove (<i>see <a href="#figp165">fig. 2</a></i>).
Then we cut a strip of strong paper, and glue it on
the back of the volume.</p>

<p>The book may be taken immediately from the
press, though it is better to not handle it for a little
while, and another set of numbers be put in. Several
volumes may be bound in a short time, and if these
directions are followed the binding is altogether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
as durable as that done at a bindery would be.</p>

<p>The next thing in order is to smooth the edges;
this we do by placing each book in the vise again&mdash;the
tighter the better now&mdash;front edges up at first,
and projecting far enough to allow them to be made
even. Now we rasp them off even with the press,
with a coarse furniture rasp, or the side of a saw.
Sometimes we leave it thus, and sometimes we spatter-work
it by dipping an old toothbrush in ink and
drawing it across a sharp edge of wood, allowing the
spatters to fall on the book before it is taken from
the vise. The ends we treated in the same manner.</p>

<p>Now we have a pile of books, without covers, to be
sure, but even at this stage they are more available
than if they are not bound at all. However, we provide
covers without expense. We use old paste-board
boxes for this purpose, cutting them a little larger
than the volume they are intended for. We lay these
covers in place, cover and fasten them by gluing the
edges of the strips of cloth upon the <em>outside</em> smoothly;
the cover goes as far back as the cloth will permit.
Then we make a cover of cloth for the back, usually
using black or brown cambric, or selesia. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
back cloth is always at best an inch longer than the
covers, and about three inches wider than the back;
we cut coarse twine into bits a trifle longer than the
book is thick, using as many as we may choose.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">
<a name="figp167" id="figp167"></a><img src="images/i_167.jpg" width="250" height="101" alt="" />
<div class="caption">FIG. 3.</div>
</div>

<p>We dip these twines
in paste, one at a time,
and lay them crosswise
of the cloth, one at
each end, at least, and just as far apart as the covers
are long (<i><a href="#figp167">fig. 3.</a></i>), laying the others between. Then
we cut a strip of strong paper as wide as the cords
are long, and just as long as the covers, and paste
it over the cords, and then we paste the cloth down
on the paper at the ends, and pin the completed back
tightly around a stick&mdash;a broom handle is good&mdash;and
let it remain there to dry. When we take it off
we slip it over the back corners of the covers and
fasten it strongly down with glue.</p>

<p>After this the covers may be finished as elaborately
as you may choose; we bind the edges of most of
ours with cloth, and then trim off the edges of some
of the front covers of the magazines and paste them
on. We make a pretty inside finish by laying in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
double leaf of manilla paper, one half pasted to the
inside of the cover the other being left as fly-leaf.</p>

<p>The freshly bound books should be piled with plenty
of paper between them to absorb the moisture, with
weights atop, until they are wholly dry. Shabby books
may be made almost as good as new by smoothing
the leaves, rebinding and recovering; and it is surprising
to see how pretty bits of wrapping paper, and bits
of brown, black, or gray cloth can be made to serve
in this work; bits of leather may be used on the
corners of covers. Sabbath-school papers, Lesson
Quarterlies, etc., may thus be made into pretty volumes
very easily. Five cents’ worth of glue will bind a
great many volumes, and the gluing is a much easier
and better way than sewing.</p>

<h2><a name="XX_HOW_TO_PHOTOGRAPH" id="XX_HOW_TO_PHOTOGRAPH"></a>XX.&mdash;HOW TO PHOTOGRAPH.</h2>


<p class="drop-capt">NEARLY ten years ago I took lessons in landscape
photography, and since then have made
hundreds of photographs of places rarely visited, of
strange people and wonderful vegetation, which have
delighted the eyes of many friends. Assuming that
many members of the Reading Union will wish to
retain more permanent pictures of vacation scenes
this summer than can be carried in memory alone, I
propose to show how they can do this with little
trouble and expense.</p>

<p>First, I must congratulate you upon your good fortune
in being able to enter upon the study of photography
in the year 1882, rather than twenty, or even
ten, years earlier. In no other department of
science, except perhaps in electricity, has such an
advance been made. It was only in 1839 that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
Daguerre published his success in obtaining an image
on a silver plate, and in 1851 that the collodion process&mdash;that
most in use at the present day&mdash;was
given to the world. But within the past few years
improvements have been made, by means of which
the art is not confined to professional workmen, but
can be enjoyed by all the young folks in the land.</p>

<p>I well remember the disadvantages attending outdoor
photography, even no longer ago than when I
made my first attempts. By the collodion or wet
process it was absolutely necessary to carry a large
trunk full of chemicals and bulky apparatus. Among
other things there was the “dark tent;” in its most
compact form it was a box, about two feet and a half
square, with curtains and aprons arranged so as to
exclude all <em>actinic</em> or chemical light. After setting
your camera in position and focusing the picture, you
had to retire into the dark tent, arrange the curtains
about you to exclude all outside light, and consequently
air, and then you coated the glass plate with
collodion and dipped it into the “silver bath” to
make it sensitive to light. This operation required
several minutes, and if the day was hot and sultry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
the operator in the dark box was nearly suffocated
before he emerged with the prepared plate ready for
the camera. After exposing this he was obliged to
hide himself again in that hot box full of chemical
fumes, and there “develop” the picture supposed to
be upon the glass.</p>

<p>With the discovery that plates could be prepared
ready for use at any time, and that would remain
sensitive to the action of light for months, a new field
was opened, in which any one could wander who had
the inclination. By this discovery all the bottles of
chemicals, with the dark tent and the clumsy apparatus,
were done away with. Materials for a hundred
photographs can now be carried in a small valise or
in an ordinary trunk amongst clothes and books.</p>

<p>Though an amateur, and having no greater interest
in photography than arose from a desire to secure
pictures of the spots I visited, I hailed the appearance
of the “dry plates” and their simpler mode
of use, for I was heartily tired of the old way. My
fingers were always black with silver stains, and my
clothes streaked and stained with salts of iron and
soda. My accidents, from the tipping over of chemicals,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
and in struggling over mountain roads and the
beds of mountain torrents, were more than I could
count on my fingers. In Florida, whenever I crawled
into the dark tent&mdash;pitched, perhaps, on the border
of a swamp or in the deep woods&mdash;the mosquitoes
and sand-flies would make furious attacks upon my
legs and nearly drive me wild, and I would be
haunted by fear of the snakes and alligators that
might attack me in that defenseless position&mdash;with
my head in a sack and my hands employed. One
day an enormous old billy-goat, taking offence at the
outlandish appearance of my tent, as I was at work
in it, half concealed from his view, charged on it with
such force as to knock us all in a heap. When I had
crawled out from the ruins, expecting to learn that an
earthquake had passed by, I saw that billy-goat
standing calmly by, chewing his cud, and shaking his
head sidewise, as much as to say, “Get into that
box again, and I’ll knock you over a second time!”
In the West Indies it was always necessary to hire
two negroes to carry my trunk, and as they invariably
bore their burdens on their heads, the silver solution
would sometimes leave a black streak down their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
faces, even darker than their ebony countenances!</p>

<p>The new discovery did away with all this trouble.
I was quick to see this, and in one of my trips to the
tropics carried a camera and a stock of “dry plates.”
Alas! I had too hastily adopted a crude invention.
I climbed mountains, descended into craters of volcanoes,
threaded tangled thickets, and penetrated to
secluded valleys to photograph new scenes with my
new instrument. Having perfect faith in the new
invention, I did not test my plates with chemicals on
the spot, but kept them till I returned, and then gave
them to the photographer to manipulate. My carelessness
was well rewarded, for of the nearly one
hundred plates, <em>not one</em> contained a perfect picture.
I was in a condition then to sympathize with the
great Audubon, who had a trunk full of drawings,
the result of a year’s labor, destroyed by mice.</p>

<p>Unlike him, I had not a sufficiently powerful incentive
to repeat my travels, and the anticipated pictures
were gone forever. Nothing daunted, I next year
procured another machine and tried again, this time
in Mexico. In that year the inventor had not been
idle, and I informed myself upon the merits of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
invention so that my results at the end of the journey
were such as greatly pleased me and my friends; for
from the plates of glass exposed to light in the
camera flashed out fac-similes of strange idols of
stone, grand old ruins, snow-capped volcanoes, valleys
almost hid in dense vegetation, palms, tropical plants,
and the picturesque features of that strange country.</p>

<p>But, without further preface, let me tell you how
you may take pictures this summer without any of the
hindrances that I had to encounter in my first attempts.</p>

<p>The first thing needed is a camera, which in its
simplest form is a darkened box, with a lens in front,
through which the scene is focused upon a plate in
its back&mdash;a plate of glass prepared with chemicals
so that its surface is sensitive to the light admitted
through the lens.</p>

<p>A few seconds of time is generally sufficient for
the transmission of an impression to this plate, and
before and after that “exposure” it must be kept
away from all light until the “latent image”&mdash;the
picture we cannot yet see&mdash;has been brought out and
“fixed” by means of chemicals. This forms the
“negative,” which is to the finished photograph what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
an engraved block is to the engraving on paper. To
obtain this negative is your first object; having got
this, you may produce from it as many prints as you
like, at very little cost, either by taking it to a photographer,
or by continuing the process and printing
them yourself.</p>

<p>While there are several instruments in the market
with which the negative can be taken, most of them
are so costly as to be beyond the reach of a boy or
a girl with a limited supply of pocket money for a
vacation trip; hence I shall choose one that is not
only very cheap, but which I know by experiment
will perform the work for which it is intended. It is
the invention of a young man who has a practical
knowledge of photography, and is called the “tourograph.”</p>

<p>At first sight it is a small mahogany box, eight by
ten inches broad, with a strap by which one can
carry it. But by pulling out a slide in front a lens
is revealed; and by drawing out another slide on the
top an inner box is shown full of negative plates.
This smaller box is fitted in position on top of the
larger one, so that the plates, one at a time, can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
dropped into a carrying-rack turned by a screw, in
the dark chamber below. This plate having been
placed in focus, the lens is uncapped for a few
seconds, then recapped, and the glass is returned
to the box above, where it is kept till evening, or
until a favorable time for development. In this way
all the plates&mdash;eight or ten&mdash;in the box may be
exposed, and their places filled with fresh ones
later on.</p>

<p>The camera is supported upon a tripod, or three-legged
stick, which can be closed up until not much
larger than an alpenstock.</p>

<p>This is the outline of the mechanical operation
necessary to secure the negative. The plates, being
ready prepared and packed in little boxes of a dozen
each, are transferred to the camera at night, or in
a dark room by day, by the aid of a <em>red</em> light. This
is obtained by placing a roll of red or orange-colored
paper&mdash;made expressly for this purpose&mdash;around
a lamp or candle, as the light that shines
through a medium of this color is <em>non-actinic</em>, or
without the power to produce chemical change in the
very sensitive plates. You now have a plate with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
latent image of the picture you desire to retain;
this plate must pass through a chemical operation
before that image will appear.</p>

<p>Imagine yourself in a darkened room illuminated
only by the <em>red</em> light, with a plate in your hand on
which you fondly hope there is a duplicate of the
scene before which you had set up the instrument. To
all appearances it is a plate of plain glass, one side
covered with a film of gelatine, and if you hold it to
the light nothing appears to indicate the change that
has taken place in that film since it was exposed to
the light. The question is, how to bring that picture
out from its hiding-place. First, you must have a
shallow pan at hand, and place yourself near a good
supply of water. Into the pan you pour the chemicals
previously mixed, necessary for the <em>development</em>
or bringing out of the hidden image. These chemicals
are, oxalate of potash and protosulphate of iron.
To simplify matters, the inventor of the tourograph
puts up these chemicals in papers, so that you only
have to put into four ounces, or a gill, of water<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
paper of the potash and another of iron; mix well,
and the solution is ready for the plate. This must
be placed in the tray with the film side up, and the
solution flowed over it. When completely covered,
let it remain, and carefully watch the development.</p>

<p>This is the period of greatest anxiety for the young
operator, for it is the critical stage of the proceedings.
A few seconds will determine whether you
have a picture before you, or merely a square of
plain glass. Gradually the details unfold themselves: the
“high lights” or white portions first,
then the “half tones” or grades of shadow, then the
deeper shades of foliage or objects feebly lighted.
When the view has come out distinct, seems to progress
no farther and to gradually fade away to a
deep brown, you have got out all it is possible to
obtain from that exposure, and the plate must be
removed from the solution, and chemical action
arrested by washing in clear water.</p>

<p>Now you have before you tangible evidence of
success, but your picture is not complete; it is dull,
perhaps obscure, and if exposed to the light of day
would quickly vanish. It must now <em>fixed</em> in another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
solution and in another dish. The “fixing solution”
is made by dissolving half an ounce of hyposulphite
of soda in five or six ounces of water. Into this
place the developed plate, and allow it to remain
until all the whitish film is dissolved away. If both
operations are faithfully performed you will have, on
taking the plate from the solution and holding it to
the light, a brilliant picture on glass&mdash;the <em>negative</em>&mdash;with
all the lights and shadows reversed, the white
portions quite opaque, and the dark parts almost
transparent.</p>

<p>Now wash very thoroughly in clear water, beneath
a tap if possible, or by pouring a gentle stream over
the glass for a few minutes, in order to remove every
trace of superfluous chemical substance that might
work injury. As a precaution against the possible
peeling of the film, it is well to dip the negative in a
strong solution of alum and water, then wash again,
and set up to dry in a slanting position, with the film
side next the wall. When perfectly dry a coat of
photographic varnish, furnished with the chemicals,
is flowed over the coated side of the glass, and the
impression is securely fixed, ready for use in printing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
Having secured the negative, your object is virtually
attained: the possession of a souvenir of a vacation
ramble, a favorite view, or of a picturesque camping-place.
If it were my negative, I should take it to
some good photographer, and let him prepare from it
the prints I wanted, as that expense is small, and involves
a good deal of labor for the amateur. But I
suppose my readers will wish&mdash;as I did years ago&mdash;to
see the whole process, and to make their own
prints or paper pictures.</p>


<p class="ph3">PRINTING FROM THE NEGATIVE.</p>

<p>White paper coated with albumen is made sensitive
to light by being floated upon a solution of chloride
of silver in water; and this, when dry, is placed
against the negative and exposed to the sun. In this
way, by pressing the silvered surface of the paper
against the film side of the negative, a duplicate impression
of the picture on the glass is transferred to
the paper. This may be repeated with other pieces
of paper any number of times, until hundreds are obtained
from the same negative. Instead of attempting
to prepare the paper yourself, it would be better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
to purchase it already <em>sensitized</em>, which you can do of
any dealer in photographic goods. A printing-frame,
or grooved block with a spring back, is used in
printing. After having placed it with the negative
and paper in the sun, watch carefully. By removing
the frame and retiring to a dark corner, you can examine
the paper by unspringing <em>one-half</em> the back at
a time, and thus print to the degree desired. It is
best to print a little darker than it is designed to have
the print when finished, as it will bleach a little in the
subsequent process of <em>toning</em>. This toning operation,
as well as the cutting up of the paper, the placing of
it on the negative and removing it, should be performed
in a darkened room. When a sufficient number
of prints are done, trim them the size they are to
be when finished, wash in two or three changes of
water, and then place in the “toning bath,” made as
follows: Chloride of gold one grain, water ten
ounces, saturated solution of bread soda three or four
drops. This will change them to a deep bluish or
purple color, and gives them that lovely tint we admire
in fine photographs.</p>

<p>The chloride of gold is sent in solution, as well as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
the soda, so that you have but to follow the printed
directions accompanying them, putting a certain
quantity of each in the water, and your toning bath is
at once prepared.</p>

<p>After toning for a few minutes, remove the prints,
and place in another dish containing an ounce of
hyposulphite of soda dissolved in a pint of water;
allow them to remain ten minutes, and then remove
and wash an hour or more in water&mdash;running water
if possible&mdash;constantly changing the water and
moving the prints about. Then dry your prints and
the completed picture is before you, ready for mounting
on a card, or pasting in an album.<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> If you wish
to obtain merely a “proof,” or a fair print, without
the delicacy of shading and tone of the silver print,
you can do this with “blue paper,” by simply exposing
this prepared paper beneath the negative, and washing
and drying without any further toning or fixing.</p>

<p>These, in brief, are the various processes necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
for procuring a photographic print; but, as I have
already remarked, the negative being your main
object, it would be much better to rest content with
securing that, and depend upon some photographer to
give you the paper impressions.</p>

<p>To recapitulate: For a short trip, fully equipped

<p class="p3">In round numbers, for $20.00 you can be fully
prepared to set up for yourself as an amateur photographer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
and after many trials, with diligence and
perseverance, can hope to secure photographs of
scenery, interiors, and even portraits, that will compare
favorably with the work of professional artists.
The above is such an outfit&mdash;except that I had a
larger camera and larger stock of plates&mdash;as I have
carried to the West Indies and to Mexico.</p>

<p>Since my return, however, I find that my friend,
the inventor, has produced yet another instrument,
which he calls his “pocket camera,” which folds up
into a small package but one inch and a half in thickness,
and weighs but <em>twenty-four ounces</em>. This is so
constructed that double plate-holders, each containing
two dry plates, form the top, sides and back of
the camera, and the entire outfit for the taking of
eight negatives, sold for ten dollars.</p>

<p>It is only fair to state that other apparatus and
outfits can be purchased at rates almost equally
low, notably those of the Scovill Manufacturing
Company, of New York, who furnish complete equipments
from ten dollars up. While I recognize the
excellence of these articles, I have selected the
“tourograph,” as being something with which I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
have experimented, and likely, from its simplicity, to
meet the wants of beginners.</p>

<p>Since the expense is reduced to so reasonable a
sum, and the road is made so easy that any one can
travel it, what boy or girl will be deterred from entering
this fascinating domain of photography?</p>

<p>If you can secure some old room in the garret, or
in some unused corner, cover the window with yellow
or orange paper, excluding all other light, and
take to it such simple chemicals and apparatus as I
have indicated, then what a delightful world for
experiment and research is opened to you!</p>

<p>The mysteries of photography; how the subtle
changes are wrought by the potent salts and acids,
under the influence of the sun, I cannot explain now.
But following the outline I have sketched, the rest
will appear as you get interested, and you will gain an
insight into wonders hitherto unrevealed, and enjoy
sensations to which the boys and girls of past generations
have been strangers.</p>

<h2><a name="XXI_ARCHERY_FOR_BOYS" id="XXI_ARCHERY_FOR_BOYS"></a>XXI.&mdash;ARCHERY FOR BOYS.</h2>


<p class="drop-capt">MR. MAURICE THOMPSON has excited all
the grown-up boys who loved in their younger
days to draw the bow, by his graceful articles on
archery for young men and women.</p>

<p>I want to tell the boys who are wide awake how
they may, without too much labor and with but little
expense, make their own bows and arrows and targets,
having <em>their</em> fun, like their elders, in this health-giving
and graceful recreation.</p>

<p>In the first place, after you have made your implements
for the sport, you must never shoot at or
towards anyone; nor must you ever shoot directly
upwards. In the one case you may maim some one
for life, and in the other you may put out your own
eye as an acquaintance of the writer’s once did
in Virginia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 140px;">
<a name="figp187" id="figp187"></a><img src="images/i_187.jpg" width="140" height="595" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. A.</span></div>
</div>

<p>To make a bow take a piece of
any tough, elastic wood, as cedar,
ash, sassafras or hickory, well-seasoned,
about your own length.
Trim it so as to taper gradually
from the centre to the ends, keeping
it flat, at first, until you have
it as in this sketch-for a boy,
say, five feet in height: (<a href="#figp187">Fig. A</a>)</p>

<p>This represents a bow five feet
long, one and a quarter inches
broad in the middle, three-fourths
of an inch thick at the centre,
and a half-inch scant at the ends
in breadth and thickness.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">
<a name="figp187a" id="figp187a"></a><img src="images/i_187a.jpg" width="250" height="66" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. B.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Bend the bow across your knee,
pulling back both ends, one in each
hand, the centre against your knee,
and see whether it is easily bent,
and whether it springs readily
back to its original position.
If so your bow is about the right
size. Cut near each end the
notch for the string
as in this figure:
(<a href="#figp187a">Fig. B</a>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>Bevel the side of the bow which is to be held
towards you, so that a section
of your bow will look like this
figure: (<a href="#figp188">Fig. C</a>.)</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<a name="figp188" id="figp188"></a><img src="images/i_188.jpg" width="200" height="109" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. C.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The back or flat part is
held from you in shooting, and the bevelled or
rounded part towards you. Scrape the bow with
glass and smooth it with sandpaper.</p>

<p>To shape your bow lay it on a stout,
flat piece of timber, and drive five ten-penny
nails in the timber, one at the
centre of your bow, and the others
as in figure below, so as to bend the
ends for about six inches in a direction
contrary to the direction in which
you draw the bow: (<a href="#figp188a">Fig. D</a>.)</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;">
<a name="figp188a" id="figp188a"></a><img src="images/i_188a.jpg" width="150" height="575" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. D. (A and B are six inches from the ends. The bow is bent slightly at C.)</div>
</div>

<p>Your bow is now finished as far as
the woodwork is concerned, and you
may proceed to wrap it from end to
end with silk or colored twine, increasing
its elasticity and improving the appearance.
The ends of the wrap
must be concealed as in wrapping a
fish-hook. Glue with Spaulding’s glue
a piece of velvet or even red flannel
around the middle to mark your handhold.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
The ends may in like manner be ornamented
by glueing colored pieces upon them.</p>

<p>A hempen string, whipped in the middle with
colored silk, to mark the place for your arrow nock to
be put, in shooting, will make a very good string.</p>

<p>For arrows any light, tough wood, which splits
straight, will do. I use white pine, which may be
gotten from an ordinary store-box, and for hunting-arrows
seasoned hickory. These must be trimmed
straight and true, until they are in thickness about
the size of ordinary cedar pencils, from twenty-five to
twenty-eight inches in length. They must be feathered
and weighted either with lead or copper, or by
fastening on sharp awl-points or steel arrow-points
with wire.</p>

<p>I used to make six different kinds; a simple
copper-wrap, a blunt leaden head, a sharp leaden
head like a minie bullet, an awl-point wrapped with
copper wire and soldered, and a broad-head hunting-arrow.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<a name="figp190" id="figp190"></a><img src="images/i_190.jpg" width="350" height="158" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. E.</span></div>
</div>

<p>To make a copper wrap, wrap with copper wire the
last half-inch of the arrow until you get near the end,
then lay a needle as large as your wire obliquely
along the arrow as in this figure: (<a href="#figp190">Fig. E</a>.) Continue
the wrapping until you have weighted the arrow
sufficiently; draw out the needle and thrust the end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
of your wire through the little passage kept by the
needle, and draw it tight thus: (<a href="#figp190a">Fig. F</a>.)</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<a name="figp190a" id="figp190a"></a><img src="images/i_190a.jpg" width="350" height="114" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. F.</span><br />(Before wrap was drawn through.)</div>
</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<a name="figp190b" id="figp190b"></a><img src="images/i_190b.jpg" width="350" height="61" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. G.</span><br />(After wire was drawn through.)</div>
</div>

<p>A blunt leaden head is made by pouring three or
four melted buck-shot into a cylinder of paper,
wrapped around the end of the arrow, slightly larger
at the open end, and tied on by a piece of thread.
The wood of the
arrow must be
cut thus: (<a href="#figp190c">Fig.
H</a>.)</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<a name="figp190c" id="figp190c"></a><img src="images/i_190c.jpg" width="300" height="66" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. H.</span></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>

The paper is put on thus: (<a href="#figp191">Fig. X</a>.)</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<a name="figp191" id="figp191"></a><img src="images/i_191.jpg" width="350" height="79" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. X.</span></div>
</div>

<p>It should look like this after the metal has
been poured in
and the paper
all stripped off.
(<a href="#figp191a">Fig. I</a>.)</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<a name="figp191a" id="figp191a"></a><img src="images/i_191a.jpg" width="300" height="60" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. I.</span></div>
</div>

<p>It should look
like this after being
sharpened like a
minie bullet: (<a href="#figp191b">Fig. J</a>.)</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<a name="figp191b" id="figp191b"></a><img src="images/i_191b.jpg" width="300" height="66" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. J.</span></div>
</div>

<p>An awl-point arrow is made by inserting the point
in the end of the arrow, wrapping with copper wire,
and getting a tinner to drop some solder at the end
to fasten the
wire and awl-point
firmly
together. The
awl-point looks
like this: (<a href="#figp191c">Fig. K</a>.)</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<a name="figp191c" id="figp191c"></a><img src="images/i_191c.jpg" width="300" height="60" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. K.</span></div>
</div>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<a name="figp191d" id="figp191d"></a><img src="images/i_191d.jpg" width="300" height="77" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. L.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The awls (like <a href="#figp191d">Fig.
L</a>) are filed like this
into teeth-like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
notches on the part
going into the
wood, and roundly
sharp on the other
part thus: (<a href="#figp192">Fig. M</a>.) These may be shot into an
oak-tree and extracted by a twist of the hand close to
the arrow-point.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">
<a name="figp192" id="figp192"></a><img src="images/i_192.jpg" width="250" height="79" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. M.</span></div>
</div>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<a name="figp192a" id="figp192a"></a><img src="images/i_192a.jpg" width="300" height="154" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. N.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The broad-head
hunting-point (<a href="#figp192a">Fig.
N</a>) is put on by
slitting the arrow
and inserting the
flat handle of the
arrow point, and
wrapping it with silk, sinews, or copper wire. These
points can be sharpened along the line A B on a
whetstone, and will cut like knives. The hunting
arrow looks like this: (<a href="#figp192c">Fig. O</a>.)</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<a name="figp192c" id="figp192c"></a><img src="images/i_192c.jpg" width="450" height="118" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. O.</span></div>
</div>

<p>To feather an arrow you strip a goose feather from
the quill and, after clipping off the part near the
quill-end, you mark a line down the arrow from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
point one inch from the nock and, spreading some
Spaulding’s glue along that line apply the feather,
lightly pressing it home with forefinger and thumb.
After you have glued on one piece lay aside the
arrow and fix another, and so on until the first is
set, so that you may put on another piece. When
you have fastened these feathers on each arrow lay
them aside for ten or twelve hours. The three
feathers will look like this: (<a href="#figp193">Fig. P</a>.)</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<a name="figp193" id="figp193"></a><img src="images/i_193.jpg" width="450" height="125" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. P.</span></div>
</div>

<p>A boy can hardly make a good quiver unless he
were to kill some furred animal and make a cylindrical
case such as the Indians have, out of its skin.
I am afraid that he usually would have to get a harness-maker
to make him a quiver out of leather,
somewhat larger at the top than at the bottom. It
should hold from eight to twelve arrows.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<a name="figp194" id="figp194"></a><img src="images/i_194.jpg" width="450" height="581" alt="" />
<div class="caption">The Target.</div>
</div>

<p>A good target may be made of soft pine, circular
or elliptical in shape. In the latter case a line-shot
might count, even though it were farther from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
centre. Pieces should be tacked to the back of this
target at right angles to the grain of the wood.
Differently-colored circles or rings, a little more than
the width of an arrow, must be painted on this, with a
centre twice the width of an arrow. The outer ring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
counts one, the next two, three, four and so on to
the centre, which of course counts highest. By this
plan one’s score could be told with perfect accuracy.</p>

<p>If an arrow struck on a line between number three
and four it counts three and a half. Anything like
this rarely happens. The target is fixed upon an
easel formed of three pieces of wood fastened
together by a string at the top, and it ought to lean
back at the top slightly, away from the archer.</p>

<p>The three arrows count seven, nine, ten&mdash;twenty-six
in all. In target-shooting you should use awl-pointed,
wire-wrapped arrows, as they can be easily drawn out
of even a wooden target.</p>

<h2><a name="XXII_SIR_WALTER_SCOTTS_IDEA" id="XXII_SIR_WALTER_SCOTTS_IDEA"></a>XXII.&mdash;SIR WALTER SCOTT’S IDEA.</h2>


<p class="drop-capt">SOME years ago, while reading Lockhart’s <cite>Life of
Sir Walter Scott</cite>, I came across a passage, in
the autobiographical part, which struck me as so
suggestive that I copied it; and here I copy it again,
after which I will say my little say on the subject (it
was when he was a youth, you know):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Wherever I went, I cut a piece of a branch from a tree&mdash;these
constituted what I called my log-book; and I intended to
have a set of chessmen out of them, each having reference to
the place where it was cut&mdash;as the kings from Falkland and
Holy Rood; the queens from Queen Mary’s yew-tree at Crookston;
the bishops from abbeys or Episcopal palaces; the
knights from baronial residences; the rooks from royal fortresses;
and the pawns generally from places worthy of historical
note.</p></blockquote>

<p>Do you suppose he ever did it?</p>

<p>Now I had had the “collecting craze” for years,
just as most boys and girls have now; and wherever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
I had been, had secured something, till a most
miscellaneous accumulation was packed away in boxes
and drawers about the house. Moreover, the rest of
the children, as they grew up, had been possessed
with the same idea. The boy who went South had
obtained specimens of different kinds of woods; the
one who was in the army had picked up relics; the girl
who went to the White Mountains, and afterwards to
Ticonderoga, had gathered mosses, leaves, and wild
flowers.</p>

<p>Besides, all of us who had a duplicate or a bit to
spare, had exchanged with some of our friends, just
as you are all doing. The thing is in the air. Boys
are boys, and girls are girls, everywhere; and fashions
repeat themselves, and are passed on. You are doing
what we did before you; and by and by, others will
do as you are doing.</p>

<p>The result was that we had a little of everything,
and a great deal, a very great deal all told; and
when spring house-cleaning came around, and as in
all proper households, every closet and drawer, bag
and bundle was turned inside out, our mother would
say: “Why don’t you make something out of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
things? Seems to me if I couldn’t, I’d give them
to somebody who would.”</p>

<p>There was the trouble&mdash;we meant to; forever
meaning to do something; but that class, whether old
or young, does not usually accomplish much.</p>

<p>But let me tell you of things that <em>have</em> been done&mdash;by
whom it does not matter. One boy started up on
Sir Walter’s plan, and set the example for his comrades
(besides correspondents); so that presently
hand-books on chess made their appearance in the
neighborhood; and there began to be a great deal
of turning on lathes, and fine sawing, and whittling,
and sand-papering. Pretty soon chess was all the
talk; and as that game is one which requires in
Wordsworth’s line (written on an altogether different
subject)</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Endurance, foresight, strength, and skill,</p></blockquote>

<p>(the strength being strength of purpose) also a
good head for planning, and a memory, it turned
out that the chessmen fancy proved a good thing.
Nothing outside of good, hard, school studies can
better discipline some of the faculties than that game.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
It is indeed no light accomplishment to play even
tolerably well. Besides, when those boys were absorbed
in chess, their fathers and mothers did not
have to worry about them when they were away in the
evening.</p>

<p>One set had historic associations almost the next
best thing to Sir Walter’s. Think of the king being
made of a piece of wood from Mount Vernon; a
castle (or rook) of a piece from Fort Ticonderoga
(we have forts, or ruins of forts, enough); a knight
from a piece of John Brown’s scaffold; and the
pawns from a peach-tree that grew from a stone a
soldier had thrown away on a Virginia battlefield.</p>

<p>Chessmen can be made from specimens of wood of
our native trees; solid oak for king or castle, delicate
poplar or birch for the queen, and so on; or of any
curious and rare woods; and almost all have some
beauty of grain or markings. They can be turned on
a lathe, and then finished in grooves and otherwise,
or wholly done with the knife. Many, as you know,
are in two pieces; and the king and queen in some
sets can be taken apart in two places, making three.</p>

<p>There are great opportunities in pieces of wood.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
The boy who went to the war brought home enough
of Southern woods for several canes; and for convenience
in packing, he cut it in sections about six
inches long; purposing to fit them together on the
same principle that a cap of rubber is fitted to the end
of a pencil; by cutting away on one piece to slip into
a hole made in the next, plug fashion, and there
glued.</p>

<p>Relics in wood can be worked into a glove box or
handkerchief box, skilfully joining the parts and as
skilfully gluing them. Picture frames suggest another
form. There is one here made by a clerk in a store
while waiting for customers. It has over three hundred
small strips, lapping in a fanciful way, and not a
tack, or a brad is used in the work; but this is too
complicated.</p>

<p>It is easier to turn out checker-men or napkin-rings,
or make pen-holders, or paper-knives. Very
elegant paper-knives can be fashioned, having one
kind for the blade and two for the handle. But all
this woodwork must be done with great care, accuracy
and nicety, not only in the cutting and dovetailing
or matching of the parts, but in the gluing and finishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
off, including a delicate oiling to bring out the
grain. It is nice work; to be sure it is. But if soldiers
in prisons can do such things as some of our
soldiers did, with not much besides a jack-knife to do
with, pray cannot a smart Western or Eastern boy do
as much?&mdash;between scroll saws and the variety of
choice tools within his reach, he is not the boy I take
him for if he cannot make himself a set of chessmen,
or a work-box for his sister.</p>

<p>As for minerals, I lately saw at a State Fair a box
on which broken-up specimens from that State were
glued, crusting it all over with stone that sparkled in
places like crystal. On each specimen was a mere
speck of paper with a number on it, which corresponded
to a number on a written list placed inside,
telling what they were&mdash;beryl, tourmaline, quartz,
etc., etc., and I thought it an admirable thing.</p>

<p>In a parlor, arranged in a border around the little
iron fence in front of the coal grate I once saw a
curious display of cobble-stones brought home from
different beaches. The lady who put them there was
artistic, and the effect was pretty. Sea-shells of delicate
varieties can be used as necklaces or bracelets if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
pierced with a red-hot darning needle, or in some way
bored to admit of being strung; some of those lovely,
iridescent, foreign shells, strung in such a way, are
greatly to be desired. You can think of so many
ways to put them to pretty use!</p>

<p>Mosses and lichens you can group on card-board
or glue them to a wooden cross. With leaves and
pressed flowers you can do no end of things. You
can mount them on card-board, or make a wreath
of them around a piece of wire or rattan; or ornament
a fan with them&mdash;a round, Japanese fan, recovering
it with silk or paper of a neutral color, for
background. One girl made a transparency with
three or four bright autumn leaves (from a woodbine),
which were gathered from among some that
had fallen at Longfellow’s gate&mdash;just where the
poet’s feet had passed in and out hundreds of times.
She cut two pieces of coarse lace to fit the window-pane,
glued her cluster of leaves in the centre between
them, then overcast the outer edges and put on a deep
binding of crimson velvet. As the light streamed
through they were gorgeous as old stained glass.</p>

<p>If you collect relics, souvenirs, momentos, curiosities,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
they are worth arranging. If you get tired of
them, give them to somebody else.</p>

<p>All these articles require much painstaking. They
will be spoiled for any person of good taste if they
are daubed, out of proportion, or awry. Don’t let
them have a home-made look either. They need
not. No reason why a boy of average skill should
not do as well, after some experience, as those sailors
in the light-ships; or why a girl should not, with care
and all her trying, make as pretty things as the gypsy
women or the nuns, of whom people like so well to
buy.</p>

<h2><a name="XXIII_KNOTS_HITCHES_AND_SPLICES" id="XXIII_KNOTS_HITCHES_AND_SPLICES"></a>XXIII.&mdash;KNOTS, HITCHES AND SPLICES.</h2>


<p class="drop-capt">WHEN I was a boy (which was not so very long
ago), it was my fortune, one time, to make a
trip from Bristol, Rhode Island, to New York, as a
sort of working passenger in the sloop <i>Resolution</i>,
Captain Israel Northup. One morning the captain
called out to me from the wheel to bring aft a bucket
of water, at the same time pointing to a wooden pail
that stood on the deck near me. I therefore made
fast (as I thought) to the handle of the pail the end of
the peak halliards and dropped it over the side. It
filled readily enough, and I was carelessly pulling it
up again, when suddenly, to my great chagrin, the
knot that I had made untied itself, and away went the
pail drifting rapidly astern.</p>

<p>Captain Israel, although he had witnessed the whole
of this performance, said nothing at the time. But a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
little later, chancing to walk
past where I was sitting, he
picked up the end of a rope,
and, running it through a ringbolt
near by, showed me the
knot which you see in <a href="#figp205">Fig. 1</a>.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;">

<div class="caption">FIG. 1.&mdash;ANCHOR-BEND.</div>
</div>

<p>“The next time you throw a bucket overboard,” said
he, “you’d better make it fast with an Anchor-bend.”
Then in the kindness of his heart he sat down on
the rail beside me and gave me a practical lesson
(afterwards several times renewed) in the matter of
rope-tying.</p>

<p>“There is some things about ropes that a boy
<em>must</em> know to be wuth anything at all,” observed he.
“An’ there mought be times when a man would give
all Cuby ter know how ter tie two ropes together so’t
they’d <em>stay</em>.”</p>

<div class="caption">FIG. 2.&mdash;THE WRONG WAY.</div>
</div>

<p>Believing that
these words of
Captain Israel
are worth heeding,
and wishing,
so far as is possible in an article like this, to do for other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
boys what the worthy old sailor did for me, I shall ask
the readers&mdash;both boys and girls, mind you&mdash;to take
a rope and practise, according to the following directions,
some few of the most important knots, hitches
and splices.</p>

<p>The first thing to be sure of is the right way to
fasten together two pieces of string or rope. That is
a thing that some of us have to do twenty times a
day; and it is quite probable that twenty times a day
we do it wrong. Suppose that you wish to lengthen
your fish-line, or add another ball to your kite-string:
how will you do it? Shall you lay the two ends side
by side and then twist them together into a knot just
such as your sister would make in the end of her
thread, as is seen in <a href="#figp205a">Fig. 2</a>?</p>

<p>If you do, you may fairly expect that your fish (if
you hook him) will get away with the main part of
your line, or that presently your kite will go skurrying
off to northward far out of your sight, until you
find it again, half an hour later, after a hot chase,
hanging tangled and torn in one of the trees of farmer
Applewood’s orchard. Such a knot is at least as
likely to slip as to hold, and, if tied in a rope, is liable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
sooner or later to cut the rope, because the strain
is at right angles. What is really wanted is a Square-knot
(<a href="#figp207">Fig. 3</a>, <i>a</i>).</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px;">
<a name="figp207" id="figp207"></a><img src="images/i_207.jpg" width="250" height="278" alt="" />
<div class="caption">FIG. 3.<br />
A SQUARE OR REEF-KNOT.<br /> A GRANNY.</div>
</div>

<p>Take the two ends and
tie them together exactly as
you would tie a “hard-knot”
in your shoe-string. Only
you must be careful and not
tie a Granny (<a href="#figp207">Fig. 3</a>, <i>b</i>).</p>

<p>One <em>may</em> slip, the other
won’t.</p>

<p><a href="#figp207a">Fig. 4</a> is a Becket-hitch,
the proper knot for joining a large and a smaller
rope. It will be useful, for example, when the keleg-line
of your boat is too short, and the
only line at hand to bend on to it is a
stout piece of hemp twine.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 150px;">

<div class="caption">FIG. 4.&mdash;A
BECKET-HITCH.</div>
</div>

<p>A loop at the end of a rope&mdash;that is,
a loop that will not draw up&mdash;is another
knot that has frequently to be made.
And yet few people know how to make
it. I know a very bright young fellow
living out at the Highlands, who the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
other day made a loop in the end of a rope which
he <em>knew</em> would not slip, and then, squeezing it over
his dog’s head, tied him to the kennel and went off
to school by himself. But the loop did slip, and
poor Don almost choked to death before his plight
was discovered. What is wanted in such a case
is a Bowline.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;">
<a name="figp208a" id="figp208a"></a><img src="images/i_208a.jpg" width="200" height="223" alt="" />
<div class="caption">FIG. 5.&mdash;THE BOWLINE.</div>
</div>

<p>Make a bight near the end of your rope, as in the
first cut of <a href="#figp208a">Fig. 5</a>. Seize this
with the left hand at <i>a</i>, and
then with the right hand pass
the end <i>b</i> up through the bight,
around behind the main part
of the rope at <i>c</i> and down in
front of it through the bight
again as in <i>d</i>. Draw this tight
and you have the much-talked-of Bowline. It is a very
simple matter, as you see; but with it you can make a
slip-noose that will give you no trouble in lacing up
your box, or you can put your dog’s head in it without
fear of coming home and finding him “dead at his
post;” or the farmer’s daughter can safely tether a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
pet pony or the bleating calf out to feed upon the
fresh grass.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">

</div>

<p>While speaking still of the ends of ropes, let us
stop and learn to “fasten them off” properly to prevent
their untwisting or fraying out. The painter or
main-sheet of your boat, Bridget’s clothes-line, your
little sister’s jump-rope, and indeed <em>any</em> rope whose
end is not (like the Irishman’s) cut off altogether,
may need such treatment. The simplest method is
to “serve” or wind the end with small twine. A
Single-wall (<a href="#figp209">Fig. 6</a>), or a Double-wall (<a href="#figp209">Fig. 7</a>), is better.
But better still is the Boatswain’s-whipping,
formed by making an inverted single-wall and then
splicing the ends back over the rope itself (<a href="#figp209">Fig. 8</a>
and <a href="#figp209">Fig. 9</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>The most elegant of all such, however, is
the Stopper-knot,
seen
complete in
<a href="#figp210a">Fig. 14</a>.</p>

<p>Place the
end <i>a</i> as in
<a href="#figp210">Fig. 10</a>,
holding
it with the
thumb at
<i>d</i>; pass <i>b</i>
around
under it,
<i>c</i> around
under
<i>b</i> and
through the bight of <i>a</i>, and pull tight; this forms
a Single-wall (<a href="#figp210">Fig. 11</a>). Now lay <i>a</i> over <i>d</i>, <i>b</i>
over <i>e</i>, <i>c</i> over <i>b</i> and through the bight of <i>a</i>, and
draw tight (<a href="#figp210a">Fig 12</a>).</p>

<p>Next pass <i>b</i> down around <i>f</i> and up through the
bight <i>g</i>, and do the same with <i>a</i> and <i>c</i>, forming <a href="#figp210a">Fig. 13</a>.</p>

<p>Then pass each strand by the side of the strands
in the crown down through the walling to form the
“double-crown,” and cut close the ends <i>a</i>, <i>b</i> (and <i>c</i>),
producing <a href="#figp210a">Fig. 14</a>.</p>

<p>A Sheepshank (<a href="#figp211">Fig. 15</a>) is a knot by which a rope
may be made shorter, or (as a young yacht-woman of
my acquaintance recently
expressed it) “a tuck taken
in it.” If the tide has
come in and you wish
to shorten the mooring-line
of your boat, or if the line by which your
campaign flag is suspended across the street is too
loose, or your clothesline, or your swing, has sagged
frightfully, the Sheepshank will gather up the slack
for you and hold it firmly.</p>

<p>When one wants to make
an artificial handle for an
old jug or some other vessel,
the True-Lover’s knot is used,
as seen in <a href="#figp211a">Fig 16</a>.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">

<div class="caption">FIG. 16.&mdash;THE TRUE-LOVER’S
KNOT.</div>
</div>

<p>Tie two loose knots, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>,
as in the first cut of <a href="#figp212">Fig. 17</a>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
pass the bight <i>a</i> through the opening <i>f</i>, the bight <i>b</i>
through <i>g</i>, pull the loops equal, and, to complete the
knot as in second cut of <a href="#figp212">Fig. 17</a>, join the ends <i>c</i>,
<i>d</i>, by a long splice at <i>e</i>.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 350px;">
<a name="figp212" id="figp212"></a><img src="images/i_212.jpg" width="350" height="220" alt="" />
<div class="caption">FIG. 17.</div>
</div>

<p>The Jar-sling, seen in Fig. 20, serves a similar purpose.
You are out picnicking, perhaps, and you suddenly
find it desirable to convert an empty gherkin
bottle into a swing-vessel in which to take home alive
some tadpoles or minnows. In a long piece of
cord make a large loop as in <a href="#figp213">Fig. 18</a>, and hold the
bight against the standing parts, <i>a, a</i>; pass the thumb
and forefinger of the other hand down through <i>c</i>, lay
hold of <i>b</i> where the crook of the imaginary wire is
seen, and draw it through <i>c</i> down a little below <i>a, a</i>,
as in <a href="#figp213">Fig 19</a>, <i>d</i>, and hold it there. Now pass the
thumb and forefinger
down
through the opening
<i>e</i> (in the
way the wire
goes), lay hold
of <i>g</i>, and draw
it up through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
<i>e</i>, forming the complete knot as in <a href="#figp213">Fig. 20</a>.</p>

<p>One more knot, the Turk’s-head (<a href="#figp214a">Fig. 23</a>), remains
to be described before we pass to the briefer subject
of hitches. Take a long piece of fishing-cord, place the
end <i>a</i> against the forefinger, wind the cord around the
two fingers and hold it with the thumb, as in <a href="#figp214">Fig.
21</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="figp213" id="figp213"></a><img src="images/i_213.jpg" width="500" height="247" alt="" />
<div class="caption">FIG. 18.<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>FIG. 19.<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>FIG. 20.</div>
</div>

<p>Now with the other hand lay the part <i>b</i> <em>over</em> part
<i>c</i>, and while in that position pass the end <i>a</i> down between
them, over the first crossing, under left strand,
up between, over second crossing, under right strand,
up between; take the hitch off your fingers, and it will
be as in <a href="#figp214a">Fig. 22</a>.</p>

<p>Next pass the loose end through the opening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
<i>d</i>, laying it against
the cord <i>a</i>; then with
it follow that strand (<i>a</i>)
over and under, over
and under, until you
have a complete plait
of three cords. Pass
the knot over a stick to make it taut, and cut the ends
close.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">

</div>

<p>The Turk’s-head knot, like the two preceding it,
will tax your precision,
deftness and patience, and
is an ornamental rather
than a useful knot. You
may weave one from wire
or cord about the handle
of your cane or riding-whip,
or you may pull a few hairs from old Dobbin’s
tail and make them into a very pretty horsehair
ring for your cousin Fanny when you two are
out driving together along the forest road.</p>

<p>The knots in Figs. <a href="#figp215">24</a>, <a href="#figp215a">25</a> and <a href="#figp215b">26</a> explain themselves;
they are often useful to picnickers and campers-out.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
<em>Hitches</em> are no less <em>knots</em> than any of the foregoing;
but they are knots used to fasten the end of a rope to
any object in such manner as to be easily cast off
when no longer needed. They are few in number,
and all very simple and easily described.</p>

</div>

<p>A Blackwall hitch is merely a loop
thrown about a hook, as in <a href="#figp216">Fig. 27</a>, in such
a way that the main part of the rope, <i>c</i>,
being pulled downward, the part a jams
the part <i>b</i> against the hook so firmly that
while the strain is kept up the knot cannot
possibly slip. Sailors use this hitch
very frequently, but it can be used on land
as well as at sea. If you have retreated,
in a game of “Chase,” to the topmost
branch of the oak-tree on the lawn, and have a rope in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
your hand just long enough to reach the ground and no
longer, just make, in a single instant of time,
a Blackwall hitch in the crotch of the limb, and, if
you dare trust yourself to it, it will take you to the
ground in perfect safety, long before
your pursuer can climb down again
by the way he came up; and you can
carry off your rope with you.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 150px;">

<div class="caption">FIG. 27.&mdash;BLACKWALL
HITCH.</div>
</div>

<p>Or possibly you might be “up a
tree” in a different way. Old Tibbetts,
your father’s gardener, not daring
to trust himself away from mother
earth, has sent you up into the elm tree to saw off
for him the limb that is growing too near the
house. But that limb must not be allowed to come
crashing down; and so, with the rope you have
taken up with you, you cast about it, while you
saw, a Timber hitch, shown in <a href="#figp217">Fig. 28</a>.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;">

<div class="caption">FIG. 29.</div>
</div>

<p>Of all hitches, however, the one which any man or
boy can least afford not to know is the Clove
hitch. Make two bights or loops, as in <a href="#figp217a">Fig. 29</a>;
hold them between the thumbs and forefingers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
at <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>; slide the left loop over
the right loop; then slip the
double loop thus formed over the
table-leg, or your brother Willie’s
finger, or anything that will represent
a post, and draw tight by
the end (<a href="#figp218">Fig. 30</a>). Practise this
until your fingers can do it swiftly and <em>of themselves</em>,
just as your tongue can say the alphabet; for a
Clove hitch, when it is used, needs to be made
quickly and handsomely. I once
saw a young cadet from Annapolis,
who had been out on a sailing
party with some ladies and had
jumped ashore with a rope, hesitate
at least half a minute before he could
think how to make the proper knot, while a number
of old sea captains sitting by were watching him and
laughing among themselves. A Clove hitch may be
used, too, when, while out fishing, you extemporize
an anchor by tying a rope to a stone. And in <a href="#figp218a">Fig.
31</a> you see again how this knot, <i>e</i> (with a half-hitch,
<i>f</i> in front of it), is used to tow a floating spar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
or drag a piece of timber across the field.</p>

<p>Splicing is a process by
which ropes are joined together
so as to leave no knot. I appreciated
its importance the
other morning when I saw an
intelligent man of fifty work
for an hour to splice a hammock rope. Where it is
specially important that the joining be a very nice
and smooth one, the “short” splice is used. It is
made by passing the strands of one piece in
and out between those
of the other. The short
splice always leaves the
spliced part thicker and
clumsier than the rest of
the rope. If it is desirable that the joining be a very
neat one, so as to admit of the rope’s running readily
through the sheave-hole of a block, the “long” splice
is necessary. This is made by unwinding each end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
about two inches, placing the strands as in the short
splice, then unwinding
one
strand further
back, and winding
the corresponding
strand of the other
piece in its place;
proceeding in the same way with the other strands, and
then fastening the ends in such a way that it is
almost impossible to detect the splice. We have not
space to describe
here the
exact mode of
procedure; but
there is scarcely
a town or
village anywhere
but has
its “old sailor,”
and there is no old sailor anywhere but will
be glad to come and give you all a lesson in splicing.</p>

<p>A splice that you can very easily learn for yourselves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
however, is the Eye-splice. First make
yourself a
marling-spike&mdash;if
you have
not the genuine
article
by
whittling down to a point a piece of hard wood.
I have found that the half of a clothes-pin,
so treated, answered the purpose exceedingly well.
Then take a piece of good three-strand rope, unwind
the strands, and place them as you see <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, in
<a href="#figp219a">Fig. 33</a>. Open the strand <i>d</i> and pass <i>a</i> through it,
as in <a href="#figp219a">Fig. 34</a>; then open <i>e</i> and pass <i>b</i> <em>over</em> <i>d</i> and
<em>under</em> <i>e</i>, as in <a href="#figp220">Fig. 35</a>. Turn the eye over, <a href="#figp220">Fig. 36</a>,
open <i>f</i> and pass <i>c</i> through it, as in <a href="#figp220">Fig. 37</a>, and pull
the strands tight. Now pass <i>a</i> <em>over</em> the strand next
it, <em>under</em> the next one, and so on with the others.
Proceed in the same way until the splice is about an
inch long. Then stretch the eye (holding by the
rope) to tighten everything, and cut the ends close.
If you will make a neat Eye-splice all by yourself and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
take it to the old sailor aforementioned, he will be sure
to think it worth while to teach you all he knows, and
he will be likely to tell you many things about knots,
hitches and splices which are of necessity omitted here.</p>

  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
